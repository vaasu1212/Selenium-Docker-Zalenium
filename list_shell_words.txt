The
23rd
edition
of
the
Sustainability
Report
outlines
Shell
s
approach
to
sustainability
and
describes
its
social
safety
and
environmental
performance
in
2019
In
his
introduction
to
the
report
Shell
Chief
Executive
Officer
Ben
van
Beurden
writes
Early
2020
has
been
a
time
of
extraordinary
turbulence
because
of
the
spread
of
the
COVID-19
pandemic
It
has
affected
so
many
people
around
the
world
Many
have
lost
their
lives
At
Shell
we
are
doing
everything
we
can
to
help
in
the
global
response
to
the
virus
At
the
same
time
Shell
remains
keenly
aware
of
the
longer-term
challenges
facing
our
society
Shell
must
further
step
up
efforts
on
all
fronts
from
climate
change
to
ethical
leadership
to
greater
transparency
We
must
continue
to
make
a
real
contribution
to
people
s
lives
The
Sustainability
Report
sets
out
how
Shell
is
playing
a
role
in
the
transition
to
a
lower-carbon
world
and
its
contribution
to
society
which
includes
helping
to
achieve
universal
access
to
cleaner
affordable
energy

Net
Carbon
Footprint
of
energy
products
Shell
sold

Shell
has
published
its
2019
Sustainability
Report
and
annual
Payments
to
Governments
Report
The
publications
further
demonstrate
the
steps
Shell
is
taking
to
increase
transparency
around
activities
that
are
important
to
investors
governments
and
civil
society
Integrated
Gas
Production
is
expected
to
be
between
920
and
970
thousand
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
per
day
this
includes
the
additional
volumes
from
the
Egypt
offshore
assets
that
were
previously
reported
in
the
Upstream
segment
LNG

volumes
are
expected
to
be
between
8
8
and
9
2
million
tonnes
Dividend
payments
from
joint
ventures
and
associates
are
expected
to
be
lower
than
in
other
quarters
as
is
typically
the
case
in
the
first
quarter
Trading
and
optimisation
results
are
expected
to
be
average
and
approximately
in
line
with
the
fourth
quarter
2019
More
than
90
of
our
term
contracts
for
LNG
sales
in
2019
were
oil
price
linked
with
a
price-lag
of
typically
3-6
months
CFFO
in
Integrated
Gas
can
be
impacted
by
margining
resulting
from
movements
in
the
forward
commodity
curves
At
the
time
of
issue
we
expect
margining
inflows
not
significantly
different
from
those
received
in
the
fourth
quarter
2019
Upstream
Production
is
expected
to
be
between
2
650
and
2
720
thousand
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
per
day
this
includes
the
impact
from
the
transfer
of
the
Egypt
offshore
assets
to
the
Integrated
Gas
segment
and
the
transfer
of
Oil
Sands
to
the
Oil
Products
segment
Upstream
margins
are
impacted
by
the
weak
macro
environment
Upstream
results
excluding
identified
items
are
also
negatively
impacted
by
the
effects
of

Refining

are
expected
to
be
weaker
compared
with
the
fourth

2019
Oil

volumes
are
expected
to
be
between
6
000
and
7
000
thousand
barrels
per
day
Marketing
margins
in
the
first
quarter
are
expected
to
remain
strong
as
the
impact
on
demand
from
COVID-19
is
not
expected
to
be
significant
at
the
Shell
Group
level
in
the
first
quarter
A
material
working
capital
release
is
expected
largely
driven
by
the
change
in
quarter-end
prices
impacting
inventory
values
CFFO
excluding
working
capital
movements
is
expected
to
be
impacted
by
the
higher
cash
cost
of
sales
In
February
we
completed
the
divestment
of
the

of
the

As
per
previous
disclosures
CFFO
price
sensitivity
at
Shell
Group
level
is
still
estimated
to
be
6
billion
per
annum
for
each
10

Brent
price
movement
Note
that
this
price
sensitivity
is
indicative
and
is
most
applicable
to
smaller
price
changes
than
we
currently
witness
as
well
as
in
relation
to
the
full-year
results
We
will
replace

Utilisation
is
defined
as
the
actual
usage
of
the
plants
as
a
percentage
of
the
rated
capacity
As
a
result
of
COVID-19
we
have
seen
and
expect
significant
uncertainty
with
macro-economic
conditions
with
regards
to
prices
and
demand
for
oil
gas
and
related
products
Furthermore
recent
global
developments
and
uncertainty
in
oil
supply
have
caused
further
volatility
in
commodity
markets
The
impact
of
the
dynamically
evolving
business
environment
on
first
quarter
results
is
being
primarily
reflected
in
March
with
a
relatively
minor
impact
in
the
first
two
months
We
expect
to
provide
further
updates
about
the
impact
on
our
outlook
in
the
first
quarter

Reflecting
the

we
continue
to
believe
in
the
long-term

the

is
not

it

not
proceed
with
an

of
the
Code
Subject

Shell
expects
to
withdraw
the
Shell
Scrip
Dividend
Programme
in
2017
and
undertake
a
share
buyback
programme
of
at
least
25
billion
in
the
period
2017
to
2020
Shell
expects
this
buyback
programme
to
offset
the
shares
issued
under
the
Shell
Scrip
Dividend
Programme
and
to
significantly
reduce
the
equity
issued
in
connection
with
the
Combination
From
2017
Shell
expects
that
buybacks
of
both
Shell
A
Shares
and
Shell
B
Shares
will
be
possible
without
significant

implications
for
Shell
Shell
intends
to
buy
back
the
cheaper
of
the
Shell
A
Shares
and
the
Shell
B
Shares
from
a
Shell
perspective
As
of
today
we
have
delivered
15
5
billion
of
our
25
billion
buyback
programme
which
commenced
in
July
2018
Since
the
Third
Quarter
2019
Unaudited
Results
issued
on
October
31
2019
we
have
continually
reiterated
that
whilst
the
intention
to
complete
the
25
billion
buyback
programme
was
unchanged
the
pace
remained
subject
to
macro
conditions
and
further
debt
reduction
We
also
announced
on
January
30
2020
that
the
next
tranche
of
the
buyback
programme
would
be
reduced
to
1
billion
As
announced
today
in
light
of
the
current
economic
and
oil
price
environment
we
have
decided
not
to
continue
with
the
next
tranche
of
the
share
buyback
programme
following
the
completion
of
the
current
tranche
announced
on
30
January
2020
Our
intention
to
complete
the
25
billion
share
buyback
programme
remains
unchanged
but
it
is
not
likely
to
be
feasible
before
the
end
of
2020
Shell
will
continue
to
monitor
the
evolving
business
environment
and
make
decisions
on
further
tranches
of
the
share
buyback
programme
on
a
quarterly
basis

our
business
so
that
we
are
well-positioned
for
the
eventual
economic
recovery
As
well
as
protecting
our
staff
and
customers
in
this
difficult
time
we
are
also
taking
immediate
steps
to
ensure
the
financial
strength
and
resilience
of
our
business
said
Ben
van
Beurden
Chief
Executive
Officer
of
Royal
Dutch
Shell
The
combination
of
steeply
falling
oil
demand
and
rapidly
increasing
supply
may
be
unique
but
Shell
has
weathered
market
volatility
many
times
in
the
past
In
these
very
tough
conditions
I
am
very
proud
of
our
staff
and
contractors
across
the
world
for
maintaining
their
focus
on
safe
and
reliable
operations
while
also
ensuring
their
own
health
and
welfare
and
that
of
their
families
communities
and
our
customers
In
order
to
deliver
sustainable
cash
flow
generation
Shell
is
actively
managing
all
our
operational
and
financial
levers
–
from
focusing
on
maintaining
safe
and
reliable
operations
each
day
to
reducing
capital
spend
and
operating
expenses
Today
we
are
announcing
that
we
have
embarked
on
a
series
of
operational
and
financial
initiatives
that
are
expected
to
result
in
reduction
of
underlying
operating
costs
by
3-4
billion
per
annum
over
the
next
12
months
compared
to
2019
levels
reduction
of
cash
capital
expenditure
to
20
billion
or
below
for
2020
from
a
planned
level
of
around
25
billion
and
material
reductions
in
working
capital
Together
these
initiatives
are
expected
to
contribute
8
-
9
billion
of
free
cash
flow
on
a
pre-tax
basis
Shell
is
still
committed
to
its
divestment
programme
of
more
than
10
billion
of
assets
in
2019-20
but
timing
depends
on
market
conditions
The
Board
of
Royal
Dutch
Shell
has
decided
not
to
continue
with
the
next
tranche
of
the
share
buyback
programme
following
the
completion
of
the
current
share
buyback
tranche
We
will
continue
to
review
the
dynamically
evolving
business
environment
and
are
prepared
to
take
further
strategic
decisions
and
consider
changes
to
the
overall
financial
framework
as
necessary
In
the
current
environment
Shell
s
financial
resilience
is
fundamental
to
continued
investment
in
our
strategic
priorities
Shell
seeks
to
maintain
strong
financial
credit
metrics
and
ensure
it
has
a
robust
balance
sheet
to
manage
volatility
Shell
s
liquidity
remains
strong
with
around
20

Risk
description
We
are
exposed
to
macroeconomic
risks
including
fluctuating
prices
of
crude
oil
natural
gas
oil
products
and
chemicals
The
prices
of
crude
oil
natural
gas
oil
products
and
chemicals
are
affected
by
supply
and
demand
both
globally
and
regionally
Furthermore
macroeconomic
risks
can
affect
demand
for
our
products
Government
actions
may
also
affect
the
prices
of
crude
oil
natural
gas
oil
products
and
chemicals
This
could
happen
for
example
by
promoting
the
sale
of
lower-carbon
electric
vehicles
or
even
through
the
future
prohibition
of
sales
of
new
diesel
or
gasoline
vehicles
such
as
the
prohibition
in
the
United
Kingdom
UK
beginning
in
2035
Prices
for
oil
and
gas
can
also
move
independently
of
each
other
Factors
that
influence
supply
and
demand
include
operational
issues
natural
disasters
weather
pandemics
such
as
the
COVID-19
coronavirus
outbreak
political
instability
conflicts
economic
conditions
and
actions
by
major
oil
and
gas
producing
countries
In
a
low
oil
and
gas
price
environment
we
would
generate
less
revenue
from
our
Upstream
and
Integrated
Gas
businesses
and
as
a
result
parts
of
those
businesses
could
become
less
profitable
or
could
incur
losses
Low
oil
and
gas
prices
have
also
resulted
and
could
continue
to
result
in
the
de-booking
of
proved
oil
or
gas
reserves
if
they
become
uneconomic
in
this
type
of
price
environment
Prolonged
periods
of
low
oil
and
gas
prices
or
rising
costs
have
resulted
and
could
continue
to
result
in
projects
being
delayed
or
cancelled
Assets
have
also
been
impaired
in
the
past
and
there
could
be
impairments
in
the
future
Low
oil
and
gas
prices
could
also
affect
our
ability
to
maintain
our
long-term
capital
investment
programme
and
dividend
payments
Prolonged
periods
of
low
oil
and
gas
prices
could
adversely
affect
the
financial
fiscal
legal
political
and
social
stability
of
countries
that
rely
significantly
on
oil
and
gas
revenue
In
a
high
oil
and
gas
price
environment
we
could
experience
sharp
increases
in
costs
and
under
some
production-sharing
contracts
our
entitlement
to
proved
reserves
would
be
reduced
Higher
prices
could
also
reduce
demand
for
our
products
which
could
result
in
lower
profitability
particularly
in
our
Downstream
business
Also
higher
prices
can
result
in
more
capacity
being
built
which
results
in
an
oversupply
of
products
that
can
negatively
impact
our
LNG
and
Chemicals
business
Accordingly
price
fluctuations
could
have
a
material
adverse
effect
on
our
earnings
cash
flows
and
financial

How
this
risk
is
managed
We
maintain
a
diversified
portfolio
to
mitigate
the
impact
of

volatility
We
test
the
resilience

opportunities
against
a
range
of
crude
oil
natural
gas
oil
product
and

We
prepare
annual

and
analyse
the

of
different
pricing
scenarios
on

These

We
also
aim

Our
ability
to
achieve
our
strategic
objectives
depends
on
how
we
react
to
competitive
forces
We
face
competition
in
each
of
our
businesses
We
seek
to
differentiate
our
products
however
many
of
them
are
competing
in
commodity-type
markets
Accordingly
failure
to
manage
our
costs
as
well
as
our
operational
performance
could
result
in
a
material
adverse
effect
on
our
earnings
cash
flows
and
financial
condition
We
also
compete
with
state-owned
oil
and
gas
entities
with
access
to
vast
financial
resources
State-owned
entities
could
be
motivated
by
political
or
other
factors
in
making
their
business
decisions
Accordingly
when
bidding
on
new
leases
or
projects
we
could
find
ourselves
at
a
competitive
disadvantage
as
these
state-owned
entities
may
not
require
a
competitive
return
If
we
are
unable
to
obtain
competitive
returns
when
bidding
on

How
this
risk
is
managed
We
continually
assess
the
external
environment
–
the
markets
and
the
underlying
economic
political
social
and
environmental
drivers
that
shape
them
–
to
evaluate
changes
in
competitive
forces
and
business
models
We
use
multiple
future
scenarios
to
assess
the
resilience
of
our

We
maintain
business

We
seek
to
execute

We
may
not
be
able
to
successfully

This
would
result
in
increased
pressure
on
our

position
and
potential
impairments
In
some
cases
we
have
also
retained
certain

following
a

Even
in
cases
where
we

we
may
still
be
held
liable
for
past

We
may
also
face
liabilities
if
a
purchaser
fails
to
honour
their

Accordingly
if
we
are
unable
to
divest
assets
at
acceptable

How
this

We
carefully
tailor
our

up
so
that
buyers
will
acquire
the

Shell
may
agree

We
may
fail
to
assess

properly
Such

In
December
2015
195
nations
adopted
the
Paris
Agreement
which
we
fully
support
The
Paris
Agreement
aims
to
limit
increases
in
global
temperatures
to
well
below
two
degrees
Celsius
above
pre-industrial
levels
and
to
pursue
efforts
to
limit
the
temperature
increase
even
further
to
1
5
degrees
Celsius
As
a
result
we
expect
continued
and
increased
attention
to
climate
change
from
all
sectors
of
society
This
attention
has
led
and
we
expect
it
to
continue
to
lead
to
additional
regulations
designed
to
reduce
greenhouse
gas
GHG
emissions
We
expect
that
a
growing
share
of
our
GHG
emissions
will
be
subject
to
regulation
resulting
in
increased
compliance
costs

If
our
GHG
emissions
rise
alongside
our
ambitions
to
increase
the
scale
of
our
business
our
regulatory
burden
will
increase
proportionally
We
also
expect
that
GHG
regulation
as
well
as
emission
reduction
actions
by
customers
will
continue
to
result
in
suppression
of
demand
for
fossil
fuels
either
through
taxes
fees
and
or
incentives
to
promote
the
sale
of
lower-carbon
electric
vehicles
or
even
through
the
future
prohibition
of
sales
of
new
diesel
or
gasoline
vehicles
such
as
the
prohibition
in
the
United
Kingdom
UK
beginning
in
2035
This
could
result
in
lower
revenue
and
in
the
long
term
potential
impairment
of
certain
assets
In
addition
the
physical
effects
of
climate
change
such
as
but
not
limited
to
rise
in
temperature
sea-level
rise
and
fluctuations
in
water
levels
could
adversely
impact
both
our
operations
and
supply
chains
In
some
countries
governments
regulators
organisations
and
individuals
have
filed
lawsuits
seeking
to
hold
fossil
fuel
companies
liable
for
costs
associated
with
climate
change
While
we
believe
these
lawsuits
to
be
without
merit
losing
any
of
these
lawsuits
could
have
a
material
adverse
effect
on
our

financial
condition
Additionally
some
groups
are
pressuring
certain
investors
to
divest
their
investments
in
fossil
fuel
companies
If
this
were
to
continue
it
could
have
a
material
adverse

on
the
price
of
our

and
our

capital
markets
Additionally
some
groups
are
pressuring
commercial
and
investment
banks
from
financing
fossil
fuel
companies
Furthermore
according
to
press
reports
some
financial
institutions
also
appear
to
be
considering
limiting
their
exposure
to
certain
fossil
fuel
projects
Accordingly
our
ability
to
use
financing
for
future

may
be

This

their

either

If

Also
additional

combined
with
the
potential
adverse

Certain

not
provide
any

in

we

Most
of
the
countries
we
operate
in
have
data

and

Additionally
the
EU
General
Data
Protection
Regulation
GDPR
came
into
effect
in
May
2018
which
increased
penalties
up
to
a
maximum
of
4
of
global
annual
turnover
for
breach
of
the
regulation

which
is
also
followed
outside
the

in

Non-compliance

regulators
may

issue
orders

We
use
trade

as
an
umbrella
term
for
various
national
and
international
laws
designed
to
regulate
the
movement
of
items
across
national
boundaries
and
restrict
or
prohibit
trade
and
other
dealings
with
certain
parties
The
number
and
breadth
of
such
laws
continue
to
expand
For
example
the
EU
and
the
USA
continue
to
impose
restrictions
and
prohibitions
on
certain
transactions
involving
countries
such
as
Syria
Venezuela
Russia
and
Cuba
In
addition
the
USA
continues
to
have
comprehensive
sanctions
in
place
against
Iran
while
the
EU
and
other
nations
continue
to
maintain
targeted
sanctions
Additional
restrictions
and
controls
directed
at
defined
oil
and

activities
in
Russia
which
were
imposed
by
the
EU
and
the
USA
in
2014
remain
in
force
Further
restrictions
regarding
Russia
were
introduced
by
the
USA
in
2017
and
expanded
in
2018
Both
the
EU
and
the
USA
introduced
sectoral
sanctions
against
Venezuela
in
2017
which
the
USA
expanded
in
2018
and
2019
The
US
sanctions
primarily
target
the
government
of
Venezuela
and
the
oil
industry
Many
other
nations
are
also
adopting
trade-control
programmes
similar
to
those
administered
by
the
EU
and
the
USA
This
expansion
of
sanctions
including
the
frequent
additions
of
prohibited
parties
combined
with
the
number
of
markets
in
which
we
operate
and
the
large
number
of

Any

The
global
LNG
market
continued
to
evolve
in
2019
with
demand
increasing
for
LNG
and

in

Record
supply
investments
will
meet
people
s
growing
need
for
the
most
flexible
and
cleanest-burning
fossil
fuel
While
we
see
weak
market
conditions
today
due
to
record
new
supply
coming
in
two
successive
mild
winters
and
the
Coronavirus
situation
we
expect
equilibrium
to
return
driven
by
a
combination
of
continued
demand
growth
and
reduction
in
new
supply
coming
on-stream
until
the
mid-2020s
Europe
absorbed
the
majority
of
2019
supply
growth
as
competitively-priced
LNG
furthered
coal-to-gas
switching
in
the
power
sector
and
replaced
declining
domestic
gas
production
and
pipeline
gas
imports
New
spot-trading
mechanisms
and
a
wider
variety
of
indices
used
for
long-term
contracts
point
towards
LNG
becoming
an
increasingly
flexible
commodity
There
was
a
modest
rise
in
imports
to
Asia
in
2019
compared
to
the
previous
two
years
a
result
of
mild
weather
and
rising
electricity
generation
from
nuclear
power
in
Japan
and
South
Korea
two
of
the
three
largest
global
importers
In
China
LNG
imports
increased
by
14
in
2019
as
efforts
continued
to
improve
urban
air
quality
Also
notable
was
LNG
demand
growth
in
South
Asia
In
total
Bangladesh
India
and
Pakistan
imported
36
million
tonnes
an
increase
of
19
over
last
year
pointing
to
emerging
growth
countries
in
Asia
Over
the
longer-term
global
LNG
demand
is
expected
to
double
to
700
million
tonnes
by
2040
according
to
forecasts
as
gas
plays
a
significant
role
in
shaping
a
lower-carbon
energy
system
Asia
is
expected
to
remain
the
dominant
region
in
the
decades
to
come
with
South
and
South-east
Asia
generating
more
than
half
of
the
increased
demand

approximately
in
line
with
the

in
2018
were
oil

of
typically
3-6
months
Note
that
as
in
previous
quarters
CFFO
in

charges
which
include
the
annual
reassessment
of

and
7
000
thousand

Marketing
margins
are
expected
to
be
lower
due
to
seasonal
trends
and
weaker
compared
to
the
fourth
quarter
2018
due
to
crude
price
movements

due
to
the
continued
weak

24-29
billion
range
As
per
previous
disclosures
CFFO
price
sensitivity
at
Shell
group
level
is
6
billion
per
annum
for
each
10
per
barrel
Brent
price
movement
Note
that
this
price
sensitivity
is
appropriate
for
smaller
price
changes
and
is
best
used
for
full-year
numbers
As
per
previous
disclosures
total
cash
tax
payments
in
the
second
and
fourth
quarters
are
generally
expected
to
be
higher
than
in

Transparency
is
important
for
Shell
-
showing
who
we
are

what
we
do
is
one
of
the

we
can

make
to
society

said
SASREF
has
been
a
long
and
successful
partnership
between
Shell
and
Saudi
Aramco
The
refinery
has
operated
with
good
reliability
and
has
an
impressive
safety
record
We
re
proud
of
what
we
have
achieved
together
over
the
past
four
decades
and
will
continue
to
explore
new
business
opportunities
The
acquisition
supports
Saudi
Aramco
s
plan
to
increase
the
complexity
and
capacity
of
its
refineries
as
part
of
its
long-term
Downstream
growth
strategy
For
Shell
the
sale
is
part
of
an
ongoing
effort
to
focus
its
refining
portfolio
integrating
with

Trading
hubs
and
Chemicals
The
sale
is
expected
to
complete
later
this
year
subject
to
regulatory
approval
The
refinery
has
a

Our

is
one
step
we
are
taking
today
to
support
the
transition
towards
a
low-carbon

This
comes
in
addition
to
our
existing
efforts
from
reducing
the
carbon
intensity
of
oil

to

said
Last
year
s
IPCC
report
was
a
wake-up
call
on
climate
reducing
emissions
starts
with
fossil
fuels
Shell
s
announcement
signals
that
one
of
the
world
s
biggest
energy
companies
is
pursuing
a
decarbonisation
strategy
with
a
broad
set
of
solutions
including
by
investing
in
nature
By
doing
so
it
is
helping
to
curb
global
deforestation
restore
vital
ecosystems
and
help
communities
develop
sustainably
Shell
is
the
first
in
the
industry
to
set
near-term
targets
for
the
emissions
of
both
its
operations
and
its
products
this
is
clear
progress
but
it
also
illustrates
how
much
work
remains
to
achieve
Paris
climate
targets
We
look
forward
to
seeing
further
investment
from
Shell
in
these
areas
On
the
road
Shell
is
making
a
wider
range
of
transport
solutions
available
to
customers
The
company
is
stepping
up
its
investments
in
lower-carbon
options
from
battery
electric
vehicle
charging
to
liquefied
natural
gas
and
hydrogen
For
example
in
Europe
customers
can
now
access
100
000
electric
vehicle
charge
points
through
New
Motion
a
Shell
company
Today
Shell
announces
that
it
is
also
investing
in
200
new
rapid
electric
vehicle
charge-points
powered
by
renewable
energy
on
its
forecourts
in
the
Netherlands
on
top
of
500
ultra-fast
chargers
being
installed
on
Shell
forecourts
across
Europe
in
partnership
with
IONITY
For
customers
who
drive
internal
combustion
engine
vehicles
Shell
is
making
it
simpler
for
them
to
reduce
their
carbon
footprint
through
low-carbon
biofuels
and
carbon
neutral
driving
From
April
17th
customers
who
fill
up
at
a
Shell
service
station
in
the
Netherlands
will
be
able
to
drive
carbon
neutral
through
the
use
of
nature-based
carbon
credits
This
will
be
done
at
no
extra
cost
for
customers
who
choose
Shell
V-Power
petrol
or
diesel
while
those
who
fill
up
with
regular
Shell
petrol
or
diesel
can
participate
for
an
additional
1
cent
a
litre
Shell
will
roll
out
similar
choices
to
customers
in
other
countries
starting
with
the
UK
later
this
year
This
complements
Shell
s
existing
programme
to
help
business
customers
avoid
or
reduce
emissions
including
supplying
lower
emission
fuels
and
electric
vehicle
charging
Shell
also
offers
businesses
the
opportunity
to
drive
carbon
neutral
by
compensating
the
CO2
emitted
from
driving
their
fleet
CO2
emissions
generated
by
participating
motorists
–
as
well
as
from
the
extraction
refining
and
distribution
of
the
fuel
–
will
be
offset
by
carbon
credits
As
one
of
the
most
established
traders
of
carbon
credits
in
the
world
Shell
buys
these
credits
from
a
global
portfolio
of
nature-based
projects
including
Cordillera
Azul
National
Park
Project
in
Peru
Katingan
Peatland
Restoration
and
Conservation
Project
in
Indonesia
and
GreenTrees
Reforestation
Project
in
the
USA
Each
carbon
credit
is
subject
to
a
third-party
verification
process
and
represents
the
avoidance
or
removal
of
1
tonne
of
CO2
At
the
same
time
Shell
also
plans
to
invest
at
scale
in
forests
wetlands
and
other
natural
ecosystems
around
the
world
to
reduce
emissions
and
capture
more
CO2
while
benefitting
biodiversity
and
local
communities
As
a
start
in
the
Netherlands
Shell
and
Staatsbosbeheer
the
independent
Dutch
state
forestry
service
will
plant
more
than
5
million
trees
over
the
next
12
years
This
collaboration
enables
Staatsbosbeheer
to
plant
new
trees
in
the
forests
following
the
death
of
ash
trees
affected
by
an
aggressive
fungal
disease
said
Sylvo
Thijsen
Chief
Executive
of
Staatsbosbeheer
Shell
has
also
signed
a
deal
with
Land
Life
Company
to
create
a
300-hectare
reforestation
project
in
Spain
Around
300
000
trees
will
be
planted
in
the
Castilla
y
Leon
region
by
the
end
of
this
year
We
welcome
Shell
s
investment
in
high
quality
nature-based
solutions
to
address
climate
change
and
rebuild
critical
ecosystems
said
Jurriaan
Ruys
CEO
of
Land

Combined
with
a
technology-driven
approach
reforestation
can
now
be
achieved
and
optimised
at
scale
maximising
the
impact
of
this
investment
The
projects
in
the
Netherlands

within
five
years

Global
LNG
supply
is
set
to
rise
by
35
million
tonnes
in
2019
Europe
and
Asia
are
expected
to
absorb
all
this
additional
supply
A
rebound
in
new
long-term
LNG
contracting
in
2018
could
revive
investment
in
liquefaction
projects
Based
on
current
demand
projections
Shell
still
expects
supplies
to
tighten
in
the
mid-2020s
Ongoing
efforts
to
improve
urban
air
quality
saw
China
s
imports
of
LNG
surge
by
16
million
tonnes
in
2018
up
by
40
from
2017
On
the
supply
side
Australian
LNG
exports
caught
up
with
those
of
long-time
leading
supplier
Qatar
towards
the
end
of
2018
and
are
expected
to
rise
by
10
million
tonnes
in
2019
Both
countries
are
well-positioned
to
supply
rapidly
developing
economies
across
Asia
with
gas
they
need
to
improve
air
quality
by
displacing
coal-fired
power
and
heating
The
continued
surge
in
Chinese
LNG
imports
has
helped
improve
air
quality
in
some
of
its
biggest
cities
over
the
last
few
years
China
s
success
in
making
the
air
cleaner
for
millions
of
people
shows
the
critical
role
that
natural
gas
can
play
in
providing
more
and
cleaner
energy
around
the
world
said
Maarten
Wetselaar
Integrated
Gas
and
New
Energies
Director
at
Shell
We
saw
Asian
LNG
demand
growth
exceed
expectations
again
in
2018
and
we
expect
this
strong
growth
to
continue
Investment
in
new
supply
projects
is
picking
up
but
more
will
be
needed
soon
LNG
has
played
an
important
role
in
the
global
energy
system
over
the
last
few
decades
as
an
increasing
number
of
countries
have
turned
to
natural
gas
to
meet
their
growing
energy
needs
LNG
trade
increased
from
100
million
tonnes
in
2000
to
319
million
tonnes
in
2018
New
long-term
contracts
may
spur
investment
New
LNG
projects
typically
require
long-term
sales
agreements
to
secure
financing
From
2014
through
2017
LNG
buyers
had
increasingly
been
looking
to
sign
shorter
smaller
and
more
flexible
contracts
Shell
warned
in
its
2018
LNG
Outlook
that
this
mismatch
between
suppliers
and
buyer
needs
would
have
to
be
resolved
to
enable
developers
to
go
ahead
with
new
projects
Encouragingly
for
the
long-term
health
of
the
global
LNG
market
the
average
length
of
contracts
signed
more
than
doubled
from
around
6
years
in
2017
to
about
13
years
in
2018
Meanwhile
the
total
contracted
volume
more
than
doubled
to
almost
600
million
tonnes
in
2018

The
cross
value
chain
Alliance
to
End
Plastic
Waste
AEPW
currently
made
up
of
nearly
thirty
member
companies
has
committed
over
1
0
billion
with
the
goal
of
investing
1
5
billion
over
the
next
five
years
to
help
end
plastic
waste
in
the
environment
The
Alliance
will
develop
and
bring
to
scale
solutions
that
will
minimize
and
manage
plastic
waste
and
promote
solutions
for
used
plastics
by
helping
to
enable
a
circular
economy
The
Alliance
membership
represents
global
companies
and
located
throughout
North
and
South
America
Europe
Asia
Southeast
Asia
Africa
and
the
Middle
East
Everyone
agrees
that
plastic
waste
does
not
belong
in
our
oceans
or
anywhere
in
the
environment
This
is
a
complex
and
serious
global
challenge
that
calls
for
swift
action
and
strong
leadership
This
new
alliance
is
the
most
comprehensive
effort
to
date
to
end
plastic
waste
in
the
environment
said
David
Taylor
Chairman
of
the
Board
President
and
CEO
of
Procter
Gamble
and
chairman
of
the
AEPW
I
urge
all
companies
big
and
small
and
from
all
regions
and
sectors
to
join
us
he
added
History
has
shown
us
that
collective
action
and
partnerships
between
industry
governments
and
NGOs
can
deliver
innovative
solutions
to
a
global
challenge
like
this
said
Bob
Patel
CEO
of
LyondellBasell
and
a
vice
chairman
of
the
AEPW
The
issue
of
plastic
waste
is
seen
and
felt
all
over
the
world
It
must
be
addressed
and
we
believe
the
time
for
action
is
now
The
Alliance
is
a
not-for-profit
organization
that
includes
companies
that
make
use
sell
process
collect
and
recycle
plastics
This
includes
chemical
and
plastic
manufacturers
consumer
goods
companies
retailers
converters
and
waste
management
companies
also
known
as
the
plastics
value
chain
The
Alliance
has
been
working
with
the
World
Business
Council
for
Sustainable
Development
as
a
founding
strategic
partner
The
Alliance
today
also
announced
an
initial
set
of
projects
and
collaborations
that
reflect
a
range
of
solutions
to
help
end
plastic
waste
Partnering
with
cities
to
design
integrated
waste
management
systems
in
large
urban
areas
where
infrastructure
is
lacking
especially
those
along
rivers
which
transport
vast
amounts
of
unmanaged
plastic
waste
from
land
to
the
ocean
This
work
will
include
engaging
local
governments
and
stakeholders
and
generate
economically
sustainable
and
replicable
models
that
can
be
applied
across
multiple
cities
and
regions
The
Alliance
will
pursue
partnerships
with
cities
located
in
high
plastic
leakage
areas
The
Alliance
will
also
be
looking
to
collaborate
with
other
programs
working
with
cities
such
as
Project
STOP
which
is
working
in
Indonesia
Funding
The
Incubator
Network
by
Circulate
Capital
to
develop
and
promote
technologies
business
models
and
entrepreneurs
that
prevent
ocean
plastic
waste
and
improve
waste
management
and
recycling
with
the
intention
of
creating
a
pipeline
of
projects
for
investment
with
an
initial
focus
on
Southeast
Asia
Developing
an
open
source
science-based
global
information
project
to
support
waste
management
projects
globally
with
reliable
data
collection
metrics
standards
and
methodologies
to
help
governments
companies
and
investors
focus
on
and
accelerate
actions
to
stop
plastic
waste
from
entering
the
environment
The
Alliance
will
explore
opportunities
to
partner
with
leading
academic
institutions
and
other
organizations
already
involved
in
similar
types
of
data
collection
Creating
a
capacity
building
collaboration
with
intergovernmental
organizations
such
as
the
United
Nations
to
conduct
joint
workshops
and
trainings
for
government
officials
and
community-based
leaders
to
help
them
identify
and
pursue
the
most
effective
and
locally-relevant
solutions
in
the
highest
priority
areas
Supporting
Renew
Oceans
to
aid
localized
investment
and
engagement
The
program
is
designed
to
capture
plastic
waste
before
it
reaches
the
ocean
from
the
ten
major
rivers
shown
to
carry
the
vast
majority
of
land-based
waste
to
the
ocean
The
initial
work
will
support
the
Renew
Ganga
project
which
has
also
received
support
from
the
National
Geographic
Society
In
the
months
ahead
the
Alliance
will
make
additional
investments
and
drive
progress
in
four
key
areas
Infrastructure
development
to
collect
and
manage
waste
and
increase
recycling
Innovation
to
advance
and
scale
new
technologies
that
make
recycling
and
recovering
plastics
easier
and
create
value
from
all
post-use
plastics
Education
and
engagement
of
governments
businesses
and
communities
to
mobilize
action
and
Clean
up
of
concentrated
areas
of
plastic
waste
already
in
the
environment
particularly
the
major
conduits
of
waste
like
rivers
that
carry
land-based
plastic
waste
to
the
sea
Success
will
require
collaboration
and
coordinated
efforts
across
many
sectors
–
some
that
create
near-term
progress
and
others
that
require
major
investments
with
longer
timelines
Addressing
plastic
waste
in
the
environment
and
developing
a
circular
economy
of
plastics
requires
the
participation
of
everyone
across
the
entire
value
chain
and
the
long
term
commitment
of
businesses
governments
and
communities
No
one
country
company
or
community
can
solve
this
on
their
own
said
Veolia
CEO
Antoine
Frérot
a
vice
chairman
of
the
AEPW
Research
from
the
Ocean
Conservancy
shows
that
nearly
80
percent
of
plastic
waste
in
the
ocean
begins
as
litter
on
land
the
vast
majority
of
which
travels
to
the
sea
by
rivers
In
fact
one
study
estimates
that
over
90
percent
of
river
borne
plastic
in
the
ocean
comes
from
10
major
rivers
around
the
world
–
eight
in
Asia
and
two
in
Africa
Sixty
percent
of
plastic
waste
in
the
ocean
can
be
sourced
to
five
countries
in
Southeast
Asia
While
our
effort
will
be
global
the
Alliance
can
have
the
greatest
impact
on
the
problem
by
focusing
on
the
parts
of
the
world
where
the
challenge
is
greatest
and
by
sharing
solutions
and
best
practices
so
that
these
efforts
can
be
amplified
and
scaled-up
around
the
world

An
alliance
of
global
companies
from
the
plastics
and
consumer
goods
value
chain
today
launched
a
new
organization
to
advance
solutions
to
eliminate
plastic
waste
in
the
environment
especially
in
the
ocean
This
consortium
is
impressed
with
Eneco
s
achievements
in
transforming
the
Dutch
energy
system
through
investments
in
sustainability
and
renewable
energy
PGGM
and
Shell
combine
the
knowledge
ambitions
and
financial
commitment
to
build
on
Eneco
s
sustainable
strategy
and
are
determined
to
competitively
grow
the
renewable
energy
products
and
services
offer
for
millions
of
customers
in
North
West
Europe
With
their
roots
in
Dutch
society
both
PGGM
and
Shell
understand
Eneco
s
unique
position
in
taking
on
the
challenges
and
opportunities
of
the
energy
transition
The
consortium
envisages
that
Eneco
will
be
a
platform
for
growth
operating
from
Rotterdam
with
potential
investments
inside
and
outside
of
the
Netherlands
Eneco
could
realise
this
as
a
separate
entity
leveraging
a
strong
identity
durable
customer
relations
and
a
committed
and
experienced
workforce
within
the
company
The
energy
transition
offers
good
opportunities
for
long-term
investments
in
a
more
sustainable
economy
and
we
think
Eneco
can
play
a
central
role
in
realising
the
consortium
s
shared
ambitions
PGGM
and
Shell
bring
complementary
experience
and
expertise
across
Eneco
s
activities
which
will
support
the
delivery
of
affordable
sustainable
energy
to
a
growing
number
of
customers
in
North
West
Europe
says
Frank
Roeters
van
Lennep
Chief
Investment
Officer
Private
Markets
PGGM
Through
its
existing
business
and
activities
Shell
offers
access
to
clean-tech
research
and
development
connected
mobility
and
digital
start-ups
as
well
as
a
substantial
number
of
partners
and
customers
This
provides
opportunities
along
the
entire
energy
value
chain
from
generation
of
renewable
power
to
trading
and
delivery
at
home
on
the
road
and
at
work
says
Shell
s
Integrated
Gas
New
Energies
Director
Maarten
Wetselaar
Eneco
s
business
neatly
fits
with
Shell
s
New
Energies
activities
and
ambitions
to
continuously
find
new
ways
to
reduce
carbon
emissions
and
provide
more
and
cleaner
energy
The
consortium
is
committed
to
expand
and
develop
business
models
that
create
both
societal
and
commercial
value
PGGM
sees
sustainability
as
a
cornerstone
of
its
investment
policy
for
Dutch
pension
capital
investing
for
the
long
term
in
the
energy
transition
around
the
world
As
pension
fund
investor
PGGM
aims
to
combine
sound
financial
returns
on
investments
with
tangible
societal
returns
Eneco
would
greatly
add
to
PGGM
s
growing
global
portfolio
of
sustainable
investments
which
provide
concrete
climate
solutions
currently
valued
at
over
8
billion
dollar
lower
the
carbon
footprint
of
pension
capital
and
offer
a
unique
chance
to
invest
directly
in
the
Dutch
economy
Shell
is
amplifying
its
role
in
the
energy
transition
with
increasing
levels
of
investments
in
offshore
wind
solar
e-mobility
and
the
power
sector
Shell
established
its
New
Energies
business
to
create
business
opportunities
in
the
transition
to
a
low-carbon
future
Any
potential
investment
should
competitively
fit
within
the
company
s
strategy
and
financial
framework
and
stated
capital
investment
guidance
range
of
25-30
billion
per
annum
The
consortium
partners
understand
that
Eneco
will
be
brought
to
the
market
via
a
controlled
auction
subject
to
shareholder
approval
PGGM
and
Shell
realise
this
process
is
at
an
early
stage
and
respect
that
it
is
up
to
the
shareholders
to
determine
the
next
steps
in
the
sale
process
The
consortium
looks
forward
to
further
assessing
the
potential
opportunity
and
has
shared
an
open
letter

Notes
to
Editors
Shell
started
main
construction
on
the
fourth
AO
unit
at
Geismar
in
2016
after
taking
a
final
investment
decision
in
November
2015
The
new
unit
utilises
Shell
s
advantaged
technology
known
as
the
Shell
Higher
Olefins
Process
SHOP
technology
The
expansion
emphasised
working
with
local
companies
The
primary
contractor
was
Turner
Industries
which
was
founded
and
is
headquartered
in
nearby
Baton
Rouge
Louisiana
There
were
more
than
2
000
construction
workers
employed
and
an
additional
20
permanent
jobs
created
The
Shell
Geismar
Chemical
Plant
is
located
next
to
the
Mississippi
River
about
20
miles
south
of
Baton
Rouge
Louisiana
It
is
a
standalone
chemicals
manufacturing
plant
operated
by
Shell
Chemical
LP
The
site
produces
alpha
olefins
alcohols
ethoxylates
ethylene
oxide
and
ethylene
glycols
Shell
s
global
chemicals
business
sells
more
than
18
million
metric
tons
of
petrochemicals
per
year

Norco
and
Geismar
in
Louisiana
and
additional
chemicals
manufacturing
in
Canada
at
Scotford
and

We
draw
strength
from
being

benefit
from
shared

access
to
a
variety
of

Shell
is
announcing
the
plans
in
a
joint
statement
developed
with
institutional
investors
on
behalf
of
Climate
Action
100+
an
initiative
led
by
investors
with
more
than
32
trillion
in
assets
under
management
Meeting
the
challenge
of
tackling
climate
change
requires
unprecedented
collaboration
and
this
is
demonstrated
by
our
engagements
with
investors
said
Shell
Chief
Executive
Officer
Ben
van
Beurden
We
are
taking
important
steps
towards
turning
our
Net
Carbon
Footprint
ambition
into
reality
by
setting
shorter-term
targets
This
ambition
positions
the
company
well
for
the
future
and
seeks
to
ensure
we
thrive
as
the
world
works
to
meet
the
goals
of
the
Paris
Agreement
on
climate
change
In
2017
Shell
was
the
first
international
oil
and
gas
company
to
set
the
ambition
to
reduce
the
Net
Carbon
Footprint
of
the
energy
products
it
sells
expressed
as
a
measure
of
carbon
intensity
taking
into
account
their
full
life-cycle
emissions
Shell
aims
to
reduce
the
Net
Carbon
Footprint
of
its
energy
products
by
around
half
by
2050
and
by
around
20
by
2035
in
step
with
society
s
drive
to
meet
the
goals
of
the
Paris
Agreement
Today
Shell
is
building
on
that
long-term
ambition
with
the
commitment
to
setting
specific
Net
Carbon
Footprint
targets
for
shorter
periods
of
three
or
five
years
Shell
will
set
the
target
each
year
for
the
following
three-
or
five-year
period
The
target
setting
process
will
start
from
2020
and
will
run
to
2050
Shell
plans
to
link
these
targets
and
other
measures
to
its
executive
remuneration
policy
The
revised
remuneration
policy
will
be
put
to
shareholders
for
approval
at
the
company
s
Annual
General
Meeting
in
2020
The
announcement
is
part
of
a
drive
to
increase
transparency
around
the
topic
of
climate
change
and
to
create
clear
benchmarks
for
performance
Shell
will
publish
its
progress
towards
lowering
the
Net
Carbon
Footprint
of
its
energy
products
initially
in
the
Sustainability
Report
In
line
with
the
recommendations
of
the
Task
Force
on
Climate-related
Financial
Disclosures
TCFD
Shell
intends
to
integrate
this
disclosure
into
the
Annual
Report
and
Form
20-F
as
appropriate
The
company
will
seek
third-party
assurance
of
the
reported
Net
Carbon
Footprint
We
applaud
the
joint
statement
by
Shell
and
lead
investors
for
Climate
Action
100+

The
commitment
by
Shell
to
fully
respond
to
the
engagement
shows
the
value
of
dialogue
and
global
partnership
to
deliver
on
the
goals
of
the
Paris
Agreement
on

Shell
is
setting
the
pace
and
we
look
forward
to
other
major
companies
following
its
lead
Peter
Ferket
Chief
Investment
Officer
of
Robeco
said
When
it
comes
to
meeting
the
demands
of
the
Paris
Agreement
on
climate
change
we
believe
it
is
necessary
to
strengthen
partnerships
between
investors
and
their
investee
companies
to
accelerate
progress
towards
reaching
such
an
ambitious
common
goal
This
joint
statement
is
an
example
of
such
a
partnership
As

investors
in

we
continue
to
support
Shell
on
its

The
recent
IPCC
report
has
shown
that
we
have
12
years
to
step
up
and
take
action
As
the
world
gathers
at
COP
24
in
Poland
we
hope
that
this
unique
joint
statement
between
institutional
investors
and
an
oil
and
gas
major
will
inspire
other
leaders
to
take
bold
action
We
would
encourage
the
rest
of
the
sector
to
follow
Shell
s
lead

This
is
an
important
step
as
Shell's
management
is
making
further
progress
towards
contributing
to
meeting
the
Paris
climate
goals
That
Shell
has
now
embedded
its
ambition
in
its
remuneration
policy
offers
confidence
that
Shell
is
really
committed
to
it
As
long-term
responsible
investors
and
shareholders
in
Shell
we
will
stay
in
discussion
with
the
company
and
follow
the
progress
with
interest
We
hope
that
other
companies
will
follow

As
Governments
meet
at
the
United
Nations
climate
negotiations
in
Poland
I
am
delighted
to
see
a
unique
announcement
on
climate
change
between
investors
and
one
of
the
largest
companies
in
the
world
-
Royal
Dutch
Shell
This
sets
Shell
on
a
path
to
reducing
the
Net
Carbon
Footprint
of
its
energy
products
The
reduction
is
supported
by
a
clear
framework
of
targets
and
transparent
reporting
I
am
pleased
that
the

worked
in
collaboration
with
other

Robeco
APG
the
Environment
Agency
Pension
Fund
and
USS
and
with
the
management
of
Shell
Together
they
have
demonstrated
to
the
world
what
is
possible
when
we
focus
our
combined
energy
and
creativity
in
dealing
with
one
of
the
most
pressing
issues
facing

Introductory
comments
by
the
Institutional
Investors
As
long-term
institutional
investors
who
manage
retirement
savings
and
investments
for
millions
of
people
we
believe
climate
change
to
be
one
of
the
greatest
systemic
risks
facing
society
today
We
believe
comprehensive
and
effective
government
policy
is
necessary
to
drive
change
across
the
global
economy
All
parts
of
society
have
a
role
to
play
not
least
energy-intensive
publicly
listed
companies
Any
gaps
weaknesses
or
delays
in
climate
change
policies
and
responses
will
increase
the
risk
to
society
s
ability
to
limit
climate
change
to
well
below
2°C
above
pre-industrial
levels
in
accordance
with
the
Paris
Agreement
on
climate
change
Failure
to
act
may
also
increase
the
cost
of
adaptation
as
well
as
the
physical
risk
posed
by
climate
change
to
society
and
our
investments
In
2017
Shell
was
the
first
international
oil
and
gas
company
to
introduce
an
ambition
to
reduce
the
Net
Carbon
Footprint
of
the
energy
products
it
sells
expressed
as
a
carbon
intensity
measure
taking
into
account
their
full
lifecycle
emissions
These
include
emissions
from
its
own
operations
from
the
use
of
the
energy
products
by
its
customers
as
well
as
those
generated
by
third
parties
in
its
supply
chains
In
developing
its
Net
Carbon
Footprint
ambition
we
believe
Shell
has
taken
a
significant
leadership
position
within
the
oil
and
gas
sector
As
investors
we
are
strongly
supportive
of
this
approach
We
also
note
Shell
s
other
important
actions
on
climate
change
such
as
convening
the
Methane
Guiding
Principles
announcing
a
methane
emissions
intensity
target
and
the
important
role
the
company
has
played
in
promoting
the
implementation
of
the
Taskforce
on
Climate-related
Financial
Disclosures
TCFD
recommendations
and
in
working
with
the
Oil
and
Gas
Preparers
Forum
and
the
World
Business
Council
for
Sustainable
Development
WBCSD
to
strengthen
the
sector
s
response
in
this
regard
As
institutional
investors
and
in
the
context
of
the
Climate
Action
100+
initiative
we
have
engaged
with
Shell
to
further
build
on
its
ground-breaking
Net
Carbon
Footprint
ambition
by
setting
short-term
Net
Carbon
Footprint
targets
consistent
with
this
ambition
and
integrating
these
targets
into
executive
remuneration
As
long-term
investors
we
share
the
desire
of
the
Board
and
management
of
the
company
to
seek
a
positive
future
for
the
company
which
is
aligned
to
the
goals
of
the
Paris
Agreement
on
climate
change
This
has
been
our
motivation
for
this
engagement
Introductory
comments
by
Shell
Tackling
climate
change
is
a
multi-generational
challenge
for
society
including
businesses
governments
and
consumers
Shell
fully
supports
the
Paris
Agreement
and
believes
that
society
has
the
scientific
and
technical
knowledge
to
achieve
a
world
where
global
warming
is
limited
to
well
below
2°C
Shell
recognises
that
it
has
an
important
role
to
play
and
intends
to
respond
to
society
s
needs
for
more
and
cleaner
energy
Shell
has
three
strategic
ambitions
To
provide
a
world-class
investment
case
by
growing
free
cash
flow
and
increasing
returns
all
built
upon
a
strong
financial
framework
and
resilient
portfolio
To
thrive
through
the
energy
transition
by
providing
the
mix
of
products
its
customers
need
as
the
energy
system
evolves
and
To
sustain
its
societal
licence
to
operate
by
being
a
responsible
energy
company
that
operates
with
care
for
people
and
the
environment
Investing
in
assets
that
will
remain
financially
resilient
in
the
energy
system
of
the
future
is
key
to
delivering
a
world-class
investment
case
to
Shell
s
investors
Shell
aims
to
grow
its
business
in
areas
that
will
be
essential
in
the
energy
transition
and
where
it
sees
growth
in
demand
over
the
next
decades
Shell
believes
its
Net
Carbon
Footprint
ambition
has
positioned
the
company
well
for
the
future
as
it
underpins
and
enables
the
execution
of
all
three
of
its
strategic
ambitions
Shell
appreciates
the
long-term
relationship
with
its
institutional
investors
and
acknowledges
the
positive
role
that
can
be
played
by
ongoing
engagement
The
dialogue
with
and
input
from
investors
has
always
been
very
constructive
Shell
acknowledges
and
agrees
with
the
importance
attached
by
its
investors
to
the
issue
of
climate
change
and
also
agrees
that
Shell
s
future
success
is
contingent
on
its
ability
to
effectively
navigate
the
risks
and
the
opportunities
presented
by
climate
change
Joint
Statement
In
light
of
the
above
we
the
Institutional
Investors
and
Shell
are
pleased
to
jointly
announce
the
steps
below
that
Shell
has
decided
to
take
in
order
to
demonstrate
further
industry
leadership
and
alignment
with
the
goals
of
the
Paris
Agreement
on
climate
change
As
Institutional
Investors
we
are
strongly
supportive
of
the
company
in
taking
these
important
steps
1
Public
short-term
Net
Carbon
Footprint
targets
Shell
has
stated
a
long-term
ambition
to
reduce
its
Net
Carbon
Footprint
associated
with
the
energy
products
it
sells
in
step
with
society
s
drive
to
meet
the
goals
of
the
Paris
Agreement
Shell
aims
to
reduce
its
Net
Carbon
Footprint
by
around
half
by
2050
and
by
around
20
by
2035
as
an
interim
step
To
operationalise
this
long-term
ambition
Shell
will
start
setting
specific
Net
Carbon
Footprint
targets
for
shorter-term
periods
three
or
five
years
The
target
will
be
set
each
year
for
the
next
three-
or
five-year
period
The
target
setting
process
will
start
from
2020
and
will
run
to
2050
2
Targets
linked
to
remuneration
Taking
into
account
the
perspectives
gained
through
its
engagements
with
shareholders
and
other
relevant
stakeholders
Shell
will
incorporate
a
link
between
energy
transition
and
long-term
remuneration
as
part
of
its
revised
Remuneration
Policy
which
will
be
subject
to
a
shareholder
vote
at
the
2020
Annual
General
Meeting
AGM
If
approved
at
the
AGM
the
policy
will
include
a
Net
Carbon
Footprint-related
measure
as
well
as
other
measures
to
have
a
balance
of
leading
and
lagging
performance
metrics
over
a
three-or
five-year
performance
period
The
measures
for
each
performance
period
will
be
set
on
an
annual
rolling
basis
at
the
time
of
the
award
and
will
be
subject
to
the
annual
remuneration
target-setting
process
as
well
as
to
the
final
plan
design
The
measures
and
targets
will
evolve
as
time
progresses
over
the
years
to
2050
The
final
plan
design
is
being
discussed
with
shareholders
including
details
relating
to
the
appropriate
remuneration
structure
and
appropriate
measures
and
metrics

Review
of
progress
On
an
annual
basis
Shell
will
publish
an
update
on
its
progress
towards
lowering
its
Net
Carbon
Footprint
In
the
initial
years
this
disclosure
will
be
made
in
the
Sustainability
Report
but
with
a
commitment
in
line
with
TCFD
best
practice
to
integrate
this
into
the
Annual
Report
and
Form
20-F
as
appropriate
Shell
will
seek
third-party
assurance
of
its
reported
Net
Carbon
Footprint
and
assurance
statements
will
be
published
on
the
Shell
website
Shell
will
also
continue
to
work
closely
with
reputable
institutions
such
as
the
Transition
Pathway
Initiative
TPI
to
help
in
their
assessment
of
Shell's
progress
Every
five
years
Shell
will
review
the
updated
Nationally
Determined
Contributions
NDCs
in
line
with
the
Paris
Agreement
mechanism
the
updated
scenarios
on
decarbonisation
trajectories
and
any
other
developments
to
assess
societal
progress
in
the
energy
transition
The
outcome
of
this
review
will
be
used
to
calibrate
Shell
s
ambition
and
pace
of
change
in
line
with
that
of
society
The
first
such
review
is
currently
anticipated
to
take
place
after
2022

Shell
has
been
an
early
supporter
of

TCFD
and
will
continue
to
support
and
promote
the
implementation
of

Shell
acknowledges
the

does
not
undermine
its
support
for
the

Shell
is
undertaking
a

that
take
around
10
minutes
to
charge
the

to
be
multi-decade
producing

Shell
today
announced
it
has
taken
a
final
investment
decision
FID
on
LNG
Canada
a
major
liquified
natural
gas
LNG
project
in
Kitimat
British
Columbia
Canada
in
which
Shell
has
a
40

interest
With

participants
also
having
taken
FID
construction
will
start
immediately
with
first
LNG
expected
before
the
middle
of
the
next
decade
The
sale
includes
the
Buenos

665
retail
stations

chemicals
and

businesses
as
well
as

activities
in
the
country
In
addition
the
companies
acquired
by
Raízen
will
continue
the
relationships
with
Shell
through
various
commercial
agreements
Completion
of
the
sale
follows
an
agreement
announced
in
April

set
up
in
2011

distributor
in
Brazil
where
it
already
manages
around
6
400
Shell

stations
This
sale
offers
the
opportunity
to
consolidate
a
regional
partnership
between
Shell
and
Cosan
and
allows
Shell
to
continue
to
benefit
from
Argentina
s
growing
downstream
market
The
Shell
brand
will
remain
prominent
in

a
licensing
agreement
with
Raízen
meaning
customers
will
continue
to
have
access
to
high-quality
Shell-branded
products
and
services
The
sale
is
consistent
with
Shell
s
strategy
to
simplify
its
portfolio
through
a
US
30
billion
divestment
programme
It
does
not
include
Shell
s
Upstream
interests
in
the
Vaca

Shell
sees
substantial
long-term

BP
Equinor
Shell
and
Total
CEOs
announce
that
they
have
agreed
to
join
forces
to
create
a
collaborative
approach
to
human
rights
supplier
assessments
in
the
energy
industry
This
methane
target
complements
Shell
s
ambition
to
cut
the
Net
Carbon
Footprint
of
our
energy
products
by
around
half
by
2050
which
we
announced
in
November
2017
said
Maarten
Wetselaar
Shell
s
Integrated
Gas
New
Energies
Director
It
is
a
further
demonstration
of
our
continued
focus
on
tackling
greenhouse
gas
emissions
Such
efforts
are
a
critical
part
of
Shell
s
strategy
to
thrive
during
the
global
energy
transition
by
providing
more
and
cleaner
energy
To
maintain
this
methane
target
Shell
is
implementing
programmes
including
using
infrared
cameras
to
scan
for
methane
emissions
deploying
advanced
technology
to
repair
leaks
and
replacing
high-bleed
pneumatically-operated
controllers
with
low
emission
alternatives
Shell
recognises
that
there
remains
uncertainty
with
measuring
methane
emissions
This
is
an
industry
wide
issue
and
we
need
to
fix
this
fast
said
Mr
Wetselaar
We
must
get
a
much
more
accurate
understanding
of
how
much
we
are
emitting
The
target
for
methane
–
which
has
a
higher
impact
on
global
warming
than
carbon
dioxide
when
released
into
the
atmosphere
–
will
be
measured
against
a
baseline
Shell
leak
rate
which
is
currently
estimated
to
range
from
0
01
to
0
8
across
the
company
s
oil
and
gas
assets
Methane
is
a
potent
greenhouse
gas
but
it
has
a
relatively
short
lifetime
in
the
atmosphere
That
means
reducing
methane
emissions
brings
immediate
climate
benefits
buying
some
time
while
we
work
out
longer
term
solutions
said
Mark
Radka
Head
of
UN
Environment
s
Energy
and
Climate
Branch
This
commitment
by
Shell
is
encouraging
in
itself
but
also
because
of
the
signals
it
sends
to
the
rest
of
the
industry
Shell
is
involved
in
a
broad
range
of
initiatives
focused
on
reducing
the
emissions
intensity
of
methane
throughout
the
full
supply
chain
–
from
production
to
the
final
consumer
For
example
in
2017
Shell
brought
together
industry
international
institutions
non-governmental
organisations
and
academics
to
develop
a
set
of
Methane
Guiding
Principles
which
focus
on
continually
working
to
reduce
emissions
of
methane
throughout
the
gas
industry
and
have
now
been
signed
by
16
companies
Shell
has
been
an
active
member
of
the
World
Bank-sponsored
Global
Gas
Flaring
Reduction
partnership
since
2002
As
part
of
the
partnership
the
World
Bank
has
developed
the
Zero
Routine
Flaring
by
2030
initiative
which
Shell
signed
in
2015
This
encourages
governments
companies
and
development
organisations
to
work
together
to
end
flaring

Methodology
The
intensity
baseline
and
target
are
presented
as
percentage
figures
which
represent
the
estimated
amount
of
methane
emissions
for
Shell
s
operated
gas
and
oil
assets
as
a
percentage
of
the
amount
of
the
total
gas
and
oil
marketed
The
methane
emissions
include
those
from
fugitives
venting
and
incomplete
combustion
for
example
in
flares
and
turbines
Currently
methane
emissions
are
calculated
using
a
combination
of
standard
emission
factors
established
emissions
rates
per
throughput
or
per
piece
of
equipment
and
actual
measurement
Increasingly
Shell
sites
are
measuring
emissions
with
infrared
cameras
and
other
detection
equipment
By
2025
all
Shell
operated
assets
will
have
implemented
robust
quantification
methodologies

and
we
are
confident
it
will
prove
to
be
similarly
important

a
springboard
in
further

peak
production
of
approximately
100
000
barrels
of
oil
equivalent

which
represents
a
significant
contribution
to

The
development
currently
has

of
300
million

With
a
lower-cost
developmental
approach
the
Vito
project
is
a
very
competitive
and
attractive
opportunity
industry-wide
said
Andy
Brown
Shell

Director
Our
ability
to

In

Shell
began
to
redesign
the
Vito
project
reducing
cost
estimates
by
more
than
70
from
the
original
concept
Vito
s
cost
savings
are
due
to
the
simplified

Shell

Shell
a
subsidiary
of
Royal
Dutch
Shell
plc
today
announces
the
final
investment
decision
for
Vito
a
deep-water
development
in
the
U
S
Gulf
of
Mexico
with
a
forward-looking
break-even
price
estimated
to
be
less
than
35

This
decision
sets
in
motion
the
construction
and
fabrication
of
a
new
simplified

and
subsea

Raízen
a
joint
venture
set
up
in
2011
between
Shell
and
Cosan
is
a
leading
biofuels
producer
and
fuels
distributor
in
Brazil
where
it
already
manages
more
than
6
000
Shell
service
stations
We
plan
to
continue
thriving
in
Argentina
s
downstream
market
through
Raízen
John
Abbott
Shell
Downstream
Director
said
Raízen
has
already
delivered
significant
value
for
us
in
Brazil
and
we
will
remain
an
important
fuel
supplier
to
Argentina
under
this
deal
Shell
has
been
in
Argentina
for
more
than
100
years
The
Shell
brand
will
remain
prominent
through
a
licensing
agreement
with
Raízen
Customers
in
Argentina
will
continue
to
enjoy
access
to
high-quality
Shell-branded
products
and
services
The
agreement
is
consistent
with
Shell
s
strategy
to
simplify
its
portfolio
through
a
US
30
billion
divestment
programme
and
follows
a
strategic
review
of
Shell
s
Downstream
business
in
Argentina
that
began
in
August
2016
The
agreement
with
Raízen
is
the
result
of
a
competitive
bidding
process
and
the
sale
is
expected
to
complete
later
this
year
It
offers
the
opportunity
to
consolidate
a
regional
partnership
between
Shell
and
Cosan
The
sale
does
not
include
Shell
s
Upstream
interests
in
the
Vaca
Muerta
shale
formation
Shell
sees
substantial
long-term
growth
potential
in
Argentina

shale
resources
Apr

Shell
has
signed
an
agreement
to
sell
its

in
Argentina
to
Raízen
for
US
0
95
billion
in
cash

at
completion
subject
to
customary
closing
conditions
The
sale
includes
the
Buenos

around
645
retail
stations
liquefied

chemicals
and
lubricants
businesses
as
well
as
supply
and
distribution
activities
in
the
country
Additionally
after
the
transaction
closes
the
businesses
acquired
by
Raízen
will
continue
their
relationships
with
Shell
through
various
commercial
agreements
which
represent
an
estimated
value
of
US
0
3
billion
The
report
provides
examples
of
how
Shell
is
already
active
in
many
of
the
growth
areas
that
will
drive
its
continued
success
and
resilience
Shell
CEO
Ben
van
Beurden
says
Understanding
what
climate
change
means
for
our
company
is
one
of
the
biggest
strategic
questions
on
my
mind
today
In
answering
that
question
we
are
determined
to
work
with
society
and
our
customers
We
will
help
and
inform
and
encourage
progress
towards
the
aims
of
the
Paris
Agreement
And
we
intend
to
continue
to
provide
strong
returns
for
shareholders
well
into
the
future
The
report
contains
Shell
s
principal
response
to
the
recommendations
of
the
Financial
Stability
Board
s
Task
Force
on
Climate-related
Financial
Disclosures
and
demonstrates
the
company
s
near-
and
mid-term
financial
and
portfolio
resilience
even
against
its
recently-published
and
most
rapid
energy
transition
scenario
known
as
Sky
It
also
explains
how
Shell
s
capacity
to
adapt
to
the
transition
should
allow
it
to
thrive
in
the
longer
term
by
supplying
the
types
of
energy
customers
will
need
over
the
coming
decades
For
Shell
this
means
that
the
company
will
still
sell
the
oil
and
gas
that
society
needs
while
preparing
its
portfolio
to
move
into
lower-carbon
energy
when
this
makes
commercial
sense
Shell
s
strategy
global
portfolio
and
strong
financial
framework
provide
the
ability
to
thrive
through
potential
changes
in
the
energy
system
to
2030
Every
year
the
company
assesses
its
portfolio
under
different
scenarios
including
prolonged
low
oil
prices
In
addition
Shell
ranks
the
break-even
prices
of
its
assets
in
the
Upstream
and
Integrated
Gas
businesses
to
assess
their
resilience
against
low
oil
and
gas
prices
These
assessments
indicate
a
low
risk
of
stranded
assets
in
the
current
portfolio
As
of
31
December
2017
Shell
estimates
that
around
80
of
its
current
proved
oil
and
gas
reserves
will
be
produced
by
2030
and
only
20
after
that
time
In
the
medium
term
Shell
will
grow
its
business
in
areas
it
expects
to
be
important
in
the
energy
transition
while
reducing
costs
and
improving
its
CO2-intensity
performance
The
company
is
expanding
in
the
power
market
as
it
expects
the
energy
system
to
increasingly
electrify
and
it
is
adjusting
its
businesses
to
meet
changing
demand
in
different
countries
This
includes
investments
in
areas
such
as
wind
generation
in
the
Netherlands
supplying
power
to
retail
customers
in
the
UK
and
offering
hydrogen
refuelling
and
electric-car
charging
Longer
term
there
is
great
uncertainty
in
how
the
energy
transition
will
unfold
but
Shell
believes
its
strategic
flexibility
will
allow
it
to
adapt
in
step
with
society
Shell
has
previously
announced
its
ambition
to
reduce
the
Net
Carbon
Footprint
of
the

products
the

sells
by
around
half
by
the
middle
of
the

in
alignment
with
society
as
it
moves
towards
implementing
the

the
full
energy
life
cycle
of
the
company
s
products
making
it
unique
in
the

It
includes
not
only
emissions
from
the

products
but
also
those
from
the
consumption
of

by
its
customers
where
around
85
of
the
emissions
associated
with
the
company

energy
products
occur
Progress
will
be
reviewed
every

it
is

today
published
a

outlining
how
its

should
enable
it
to
thrive
as
the
world
transitions
to

The
Shell
Energy

Report
describes
its
understanding
of
the
transition
and
what
it
means
for
the
company
It
also
explains
how
Shell
has
designed
its
strategy
not
only
to
be
a
world-class
investment
case
and
to
sustain
its
societal
licence
to
operate
but
also
to
manage
climate
change-related
risks
and
maximise
opportunities
through
the
transition
It
sets
out
how
Shell
is
playing
a
role
in
the

and
details
Shell

contribution
to
society
which
includes
providing
people

contributes
through

and
supporting
social

Its
unparalleled
breadth

the

make
our

highly
competitive

explained
how
the

will
help

our
Marketing

the
most
profitable
in
the

Meanwhile
our

a
unique

our

find
difficult
to
match

This
follows
a
two-year
strategic
review
of
Shell
s
interests
in
New
Zealand
and
the
sale
of
Shell
s
interest
in
Kapuni
in
2017
It
is
consistent
with
the
Shell
Group
strategy
of
divesting
USD
30bn
of
assets
by
end
2018
and
is
in
line
with
Shell
s
drive
to
simplify
the
upstream
portfolio
and
re-shape
the
company
into
a
world
class
investment
The
agreement
includes
Māui
Pohokura
and
the
Tank
Farms
Shell
has
also
entered
into
an
agreement
with
OMV
to
sell
its
interest
in
and
operatorship
of
the
Great
South
Basin
venture
which
includes
a
drilling
commitment
currently
estimated
to
be
USD
50
million
The
Sales
and
Purchase
Agreement
is
subject
to
certain
conditions
which
include
normal
regulatory
approvals
and
is
likely
to
be
complete
by
Q4
this
year
As
part
of
the
deal
the
employees
of
Shell
Taranaki

and
Shell
New

will
become
part
of

upon

Today
s
announcement
is
another

towards
reshaping
and
simplifying
our
company
deepening
Shell
s
financial

We
are
proud

The
global
liquefied
natural
gas
LNG
market
has
continued
to
defy
expectations
of
many
market
observers
with
demand
growing
by
29
million
tonnes
to
293
million
tonnes
in
2017
according
to
Shell
s
annual
LNG
Outlook
Such
strong
growth
in
demand
is
consistent
with
Shell
s
first
LNG
Outlook
published
in
2017
Based
on
current
demand
projections
Shell
sees
potential
for
a
supply
shortage
developing
in
mid-2020s
unless
new
LNG
production
project
commitments
are
made
soon
Japan
remained
the
world
s
largest
LNG
importer
in
2017
while
China
moved
into
second
place
as
Chinese
imports
surged
past
South
Korea
s
Total
demand
for
LNG
in
China
reached
38
million
tonnes
a
result
of
continued
economic
growth
and
policies
to
reduce
local
air
pollution
through
coal-to-gas
switching
We
are
still
seeing
significant
demand
from
traditional
importers
in
Asia
and
Europe
but
we
are
also
seeing
LNG
provide
flexible
reliable
and
cleaner
energy
supply
for
other
countries
around
the
world
said
Maarten
Wetselaar
Integrated
Gas
and
New
Energies
Director
at
Shell
In
Asia
alone
demand
rose
by
17
million
tonnes
That
s
nearly
as
much
as
Indonesia
the
world
s
fifth-largest
LNG
exporter
produced
in
2017
LNG
has
played
an
increasing
role
in
the
global
energy
system
over
the
last
few
decades
Since
2000
the
number
of
countries
importing
LNG
has
quadrupled
and
the
number
of
countries
supplying
it
has
almost
doubled
LNG
trade
increased
from
100
million
tonnes
in
2000
to
nearly
300
million
tonnes
in
2017
That
s
enough
gas
to
generate
power
for
around
575
million
homes
LNG
buyers
continued
to
sign
shorter
and
smaller
contracts
In
2017
the
number
of
LNG
spot
cargoes
sold
reached
1
100
for
the
first
time
equivalent
to
three
cargoes
delivered
every
day
This
growth
mostly
came
from
new
supply
from
Australia
and
the
USA
The
mismatch
in
requirements
between
buyers
and
suppliers
is
growing
Most
suppliers
still
seek
long-term
LNG
sales
to
secure
financing
But
LNG
buyers
increasingly
want
shorter
smaller
and
more
flexible
contracts
so
they
can
better
compete
in
their
own
downstream
power
and
gas
markets
This
mismatch
needs
to
be
resolved
to
enable
LNG
project
developers
to
make
final
investment
decisions
that
are
needed
to
ensure
there
is
enough
future
supply
of
this
cleaner-burning
fuel
for
the
world
economy

similarity
of
this
opportunity
to
our
leading
position
in
the
U
S

of
Mexico
will
allow
us
to
benefit
from
and
build
upon
decades
of
experience
complementing
our
position
in
the
region
Shell
has
been

Mexico
since
1954
and
has
a
large
portfolio
of
businesses
that
includes
retail
trading
petrochemicals
lubricants
import
and
sales
of

The
results
of
today
s
deep-water
bid
round
further
fortify
Shell

presence
in
this
key
market
after
having
established
its
first
retail
station
in
the

operations
in
the
U

of
Mexico
where
it
pioneered

progressing
to
greater
than
900-thousand

Today
s
announcement
shows
how
through
exploration
we
are
sustaining
a
strong
pipeline
of

and

s
successful
nearly
40-year
history
in
the
deep
waters
of
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
and
is
particularly
special
in
that
it
offers
a
combination
of
materiality
scope
and
proximity
to
existing
infrastructure
said
Marc
Gerrits
Executive
Vice-President
Exploration
for

Shell
The
result
is
another
opportunity
to
think
differently
about
ways
we
can
competitively
develop
deep-water
resources
This
major
discovery
in
a
Shell
heartland
adds
to
the
company
s
Paleogene
exploration
success
in
the
Perdido
area
Through
exploration
Royal
Dutch
Shell
has
added
more
than
one
billion
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
resources
in
the
last
decade
in
the
Gulf
of

Shell
currently
has
three
Gulf

deep-water
projects
under
construction
–
Appomattox

and
Coulomb
Phase

–
as
well
as
investment
options
for
additional
subsea
tiebacks
and
Vito
a
potential
new
hub
in
the
region
The
Shell
group
expects
its
global
deep-water
production
to
exceed
900

in
order
to
re-shape

into
a
simpler
more

takes
Shell
a
step
closer
to
its

target
of
30
billion

a
wholly-owned

for
a
transaction
value
of
750

The
transaction
is
expected
to
complete
in
the
second
quarter
of
2018
subject

first
new
manned
installation
for
Shell
in
the
northern
North

in
almost
30

is
an
attractive
opportunity
with
a
competitive
go-forward

price
below
40

barrel
The

said
Andy
Brown
Upstream

It
is
another

of
how
we

in
support
of

The
redevelopment
of

required
when

see
an
additional
eight
wells
drilled
which
will
be
tied
back

Steve
Phimister
Vice

said
Shell
has
had
a
strong
presence
in
this
part
of
the
northern
North

for
more
than
forty
years
Having
reshaped

twelve
months
we
now
plan
to
grow
our
North

production
through
our
core

assets
In
doing
so
we
will
continue
to
work
with
the

on
the

have
incurred
an
estimated

to
reflect
the

tax
rate

to
be
favourable

Shell
Chief
Executive
Officer
Ben
van
Beurden
today
updated
investors
on
the
company
s
strategy
setting
out
plans
to
grow
returns
and
free
cash
flow
and
outlining
its
ambition
to
reduce
the
net
carbon
footprint
of
its
energy
products
Our
next
steps
as
we
re-shape
Shell
into
a
world-class
investment
aim
to
ensure
that
our
company
can
continue
to
thrive
not
just
in
the
short
and
medium
term
but
for
many
decades
to
come
said
van
Beurden
These
steps
build
on
the
foundations
of
Shell
s
strong
operational
and
financial
performance
and
my
confidence
in
our
strategy
and
our
ability
to
deliver
on
the
promises
we
make
Van
Beurden
highlighted
three
updates
from
his
presentation
We
have
increased
our
outlook
for
organic
free
cash
flow
which
has
been
consistently
strong
over
the
past
five
quarters
We
have
also
made
significant
progress
with
our
divestment
programme
allowing
us
to
reduce
net
debt
in
that
time
Meanwhile
we
intend
to
cancel
our
scrip
dividend
programme
with
effect
from
the
fourth
quarter
2017
The
company
also
announced
a
net
carbon
footprint
ambition
covering
not
just
emissions
from
its
own
operations
but
also
those
produced
when
using
Shell
products
Shell
aims
to
cut
the
net
carbon
footprint
of
its
energy
products
–
expressed
in
grams
of
CO2
per
megajoule
consumed
–
by
around
half
by
2050
As
an
interim
step
by
2035
we
aim
to
reduce
it
by
around
20
said
van
Beurden
We
will
do
this
in
step
with
society
s
drive
to
align
with
the
Paris
goals
and
we
will
do
it
by
reducing
the
net
carbon
footprint
of
the
full
range
of
Shell
emissions
from
our
operations
and
from
the
consumption
of
our
products
Van
Beurden
concluded
Taken
together
these
next
steps
and
the
strategy
and
portfolio
strength
that
underpin
them
will
deepen
Shell
s
financial
resilience
and
competitiveness
help
to
ensure
our
long-term
business
relevance
and
keep
us
firmly
on
the
path
to
becoming
and
remaining
a
world-class
investment
Financial
outlook
Shell
has
made
the
following
updates
to
the
company
s
financial
outlook
The
outlook
for
annual
organic
free
cash
flow
has
increased
to
25
to
30
billion
by
2020
at
a
Brent
crude
oil
price
of
60
per
barrel
real
terms
2016
This
is
5
billion
more
than
the
outlook
Shell
provided
during
its
capital
markets
day
in
June
2016
Debt
reduction
remains
a
priority
Gearing
stood
at
25
4
at
the
end
of
Q3
2017
and
additional
divestment
proceeds
of
more
than
5
billion
since
then
mean
that
20
gearing
is
in
sight
The
delivery
of
new
projects
continues
and
the
company
remains
on
track
to
deliver
1
million
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
per
day
and
10
billion
of
cash
flow
from
operations
from
new
projects
by
2018
at
60
per
barrel
real
terms
2016
We
expect
to
deliver
an
incremental
5
billion
cash
flow
from
operations
by
2020
The
30
billion
divestment
programme
between
2016
and
2018
is
almost
delivered
with
deals
worth
23
billion
completed
headline
2
billion
announced
and
5
billion
in
advanced
progress
Once
this
programme
is
completed
the
company
expects
to
continue
divestments
at
an
average
rate
of
more
than
5
billion
until
at
least
2020
The
company
s
commitment
to
capital
discipline
remains
Annual
capital
investment
will
continue
to
be
between
25
and
30
billion
and
at
current
oil
prices
capital
investment
will
be
managed
towards
the
bottom
end
of
that
range
or
lower
if
needed
Annual
underlying
operational
expenditure
will
remain
below
38
billion
until
2020
with
efficiency
gains
expected
to
deliver
further
reductions
building
on
the
more
than
20
reduction
in
operational
expenditure
since
2014
The
company
expects
to
continue
to
grow
organic
free
cash
flow
throughout
the
2020s
at
a
more
moderate
rate
Increased
distributions
to
shareholders
in
the
form
of
share
buybacks
in
line
with
the
plans
confirmed
below
is
expected
to
support
a
stronger
growth
in
its
metrics
per
share
Increasing
distributions
to

The
company
is
confident
it
can
cancel
its
scrip
dividend
programme
while
investing
at
sufficient
levels
to
maintain
value
accretive
growth
in
the
portfolio
The
strength
of
its
balance
sheet
coupled
with
stronger
cash
flow
and
a
relentless
focus
on
capital
efficiency
discipline
and
flexibility
have
given
the
company
the
confidence
to
cancel

programme
with
effect
from

Separately
as
per
intentions
stated
in
December
2015
at
the
time
of
the
combination
with
BG
the
company
is
confirming
the
plans
for
share
buybacks
of
at
least
25
billion
in
the
period
2017-2020

Strategy
updates
Against
the
backdrop
of
ongoing
volatility
in
the
energy
sector
Shell
today
presented
the
following
updates
to
investors
In
Integrated
Gas
the
resilience
and
good
financial
performance
of
the
business
continue
to
be
underpinned
by
its
position
as
a
leader
in
both
the
global
liquefied
natural
gas
LNG
and
gas-to-liquids
value
chains
as
well
as
by
the
underlying
strength
Shell
sees
in
natural
gas
and
LNG
markets
To
sustain
its
strength
and
competitive
advantage
in
LNG
through
the
2020s
the
company
will
continue
to
assess
opportunities
for
selective
growth
–
cost
competitiveness
will
be
a
key
decision
criterion
Upstream
has
implemented
a
successful
and
continuing
operational
excellence
programme
delivering
more
production
and
lower
costs
A
focus
on
capital
efficiency
and
portfolio
optimisation
has
led
to
a
more
resilient
and
competitive
performance
Management
is
confident
in
the
growth
increasing
returns
and
sustainability
of
the
company
s
upstream
portfolio
into
the
next
decade
Downstream
continues
to
deliver
strong
financial
performance
due
to
highly
integrated
refining
trading
and
marketing
operations
and
premium
products
in
addition
to
competitive
growth
in
the
Chemicals
business
Strong
brand
and
customer
reach
are
key
differentiators
that
Shell
will
leverage
further
to
increase
the
size
of
this
growing
and
high
return
business
The
development
of
new
energies
as
a
future
growth
platform
will
accelerate
and
the
company
will
increase
the
capital
allocated
to
this
business
to
1
to
2
billion
per
year
until
2020
Shell
will
continue
to
target
opportunities
in
new
fuels
and
power
two
businesses
adjacent
to
its
Downstream
and
gas
businesses
that
play
to
Shell
s
existing
strengths
in
brand
and
value-chain
integration
Shell
groups
its
seven
strategic
themes
into
three
categories
–
cash
engines
growth
priorities
and
emerging
opportunities
Integrated
Gas
conventional
oil
and
gas
and
Oil
Products
are
currently
cash
engines
deep
water
and
Chemicals
are
growth
priorities
shales
and
new
energies
are
emerging
opportunities
Illustrating
the
dynamic
nature
of
the
company
s
portfolio
the
intention
is
for
deep
water
to
have
become
a
cash
engine
by
2020
and
shales
to
have
become
a
growth
priority
by
2020
Reducing
net
carbon
footprint
Shell
further
positioned
itself
for
the
future
today
by
unveiling
its
ambition
to
cut
the
net
carbon
footprint
of
its
energy
products
by
around
half
by
2050
As
an
interim
step
by
2035
it
will
aim
for
a
reduction
of
20
The
company
will
measure
its
progress
by
disclosing
the
net
carbon
footprint
not
just
from
its
operations
and
energy
use
as
it
does
now
but
also
from
the
use
of
its
energy
products
expressed
in
grams
of
CO2
per
megajoule
consumed
and
taking
account
of
any
emissions
offset
This
measure
will
be
tracked
over
time
with
reviews
every
five
years
to
ensure
Shell
is
progressing
in
line
with
societal
progress
towards
the
carbon
footprint
reduction
required
to
meet
the
Paris
goals
Tackling
climate
change
is
a
cross-generational
global
and
multi-faceted
effort
van
Beurden
said
This
is
a
challenge
for
the
whole
planet
for
all
of
society
for
customers
for
governments
and
indeed
for
businesses
It
will
mean
meeting
increasing
energy
demand
with
an
ever-lower
carbon
footprint
And
it
is
critical
that
our
ambition
covers
the
full
energy
lifecycle
from
production
to
consumption
We
are
committed
to
play
our
part

CAUTIONARY
NOTE
Nov

The
Board
of
Royal
Dutch
Shell
plc
RDS
today
announced
the
Reference
Share
Price
in
respect
of
the
third
quarter
interim
dividend
of
2017
which

The
commitment
was
made
as
part
of
wider
efforts
by
the
global
energy
industry
to
ensure
that
natural
gas
continues
to
play
a
critical
role
in
helping
meet
future
energy
demand
while
addressing
climate
change
Since
natural
gas
consists
mainly
of
methane
a
potent
greenhouse
gas
its
role
in
the
transition
to
a
low-carbon
future
will
be
influenced
by
the
extent
to
which
methane
emissions
are
reduced
The
eight
energy
companies
today
signed
a
Guiding
Principles
document
which
focuses
on
continually
reducing
methane
emissions
advancing
strong
performance
across
gas
value
chains
improving
accuracy
of
methane
emissions
data
advocating
sound
policies
and
regulations
on
methane
emissions
and
increasing
transparency
Numerous
studies
have
shown
the
importance
of
quickly
reducing
methane
emissions
if
we
re
to
meet
growing
energy
demand
and
multiple
environmental
goals
said
Mark
Radka
Head
of
UN
Environment
s
Energy
and
Climate
Branch
The
Guiding
Principles
provide
an
excellent
framework
for
doing
so
across
the
entire
natural
gas
value
chain
particularly
if
they
re
linked
to
reporting
on
the
emissions
reductions
achieved
The
Guiding
Principles
were
developed
in
collaboration
with
the
Environmental
Defense
Fund
the
International
Energy
Agency
IEA
the
International
Gas
Union
the
Oil
and
Gas
Climate
Initiative

Rocky
Mountain
Institute
the
Sustainable
Gas
Institute
The
Energy
and
Resources
Institute
and
United
Nations
Environment
Our
analysis
at
IEA
shows
that
credible
action
to
minimise
methane
emissions
is
essential
to
the
achievement
of
global
climate
goals
and
to
the
outlook
for
natural
gas
said
Tim
Gould
Head
of
Supply
Division
World
Energy
Outlook
IEA
The
commitment
by
companies
to
the
Guiding
Principles
is
a
very
important
step
we
look
forward
to
seeing
the
results
of
their
implementation
and
wider
application
The
opportunity
is
considerable
–
implementing
all
of
the
cost-effective
methane
abatement
measures
worldwide
would
have
the
same
effect
on
long-term
climate
change
as
closing
all
existing
coal-fired
power
plants

emissions
from

The

also
agreed

Recent
history
of
Shell
s
investment
in
Woodside
In
November
2010
Shell
sold
10
of
the
issued
capital
of
Woodside
retaining
a
24
27
interest
in
Woodside
This
interest
was
further
diluted
to
23
08
because
of
Shell
s
decision
not
to
participate
in
Woodside
s
dividend
re-investment
programme
In
June
2014
Shell
sold
approximately
78
27
million
shares
in
Woodside
representing
9
5
of
Woodside
s
issued
share
capital
retaining
an
interest
of
13
58
This
interest
was
further
diluted
to
13
28
because
of
Shell
s
decision
not
to
participate
in
Woodside
s
dividend
re-investment
programme
During
the
second
quarter
2016
Shell
management
concluded
that
a
change
in
Shell
s
level
of
involvement
over
Woodside
s
financial
and
operating
policy
decisions
resulted
in
Shell
no
longer
having
significant
influence
Its
classification
was
therefore
changed
from
an
associate
carrying
amount
2
144
million
to
an
investment
in
securities
carrying

Memorandum
of
Understanding
MoU
focuses
on
sharing
technical
and
cost-efficient
solutions
Over
the
next
10
years
if
market
conditions
continue
to
develop
at
their
current
rates
Shell
plans
to
invest
around
1
billion
in
Mexico
These
investments
will
be
channeled
into
expanding
and
improving
the
retail
network
improving
fuel
logistics
infrastructure
and
developing
partnerships
to
deliver
world-class
products
and
services
to
Mexican
consumers
and
businesses
This
is
a
major
milestone
for
Shell
and
shows
our
ongoing
commitment
to
Mexico
As
the
fifth-biggest
consumer
of
gasoline
in
the
world
it
is
an
important
and
growing
market
said
István
Kapitány
Shell
Executive
Vice
President
of
Retail
We
have
been
present
in
Mexico
for
more
than
60
years
but
this
is
our
first
opportunity
to
improve
Mexican
motorists
journeys
through
our
unique
retail
experience
Shell
is
the
largest
fuels
retailer
in
the
world
with
43
000
retail
stations
across
around
80
countries
serving
about
30
million
customers
daily
In
addition
to
Mexico
Shell
is
investing
in
several
other
high-growth
markets
–
such
as
India
China
Indonesia
and
Brazil
–
as
part
of
its
expansion
strategy
for
the
next
decade
The
new
service
station
in
Tlalnepantla
on
the
outskirts
of
Mexico
City
promises
an
improved
experience
for
Mexican
motorists
and
their
families
providing
them
with
high-quality
fuels
in
a
welcoming
environment
The
new
service
station
will
also
offer
freshly-brewed
gourmet
coffee
healthy
fresh
food
and
free
Wi-Fi
reflecting
Shell
s
focus
on
delivering
a
world-class
retail
experience
to
customers
Shell
Retail
s
ambitions
for
2025
include
growing
the
convenience
retail
offer
significantly
increasing
the
availability
of
low-emission
fuels
and
reducing
waste
Pedro

Coldwell
Mexican
Secretary
of
Energy
welcomed
Shell
s
entry
into
Mexico
s
burgeoning
retail
fuel
market
The
opening
of
fuel
stations
is
important
for
Mexico
given
that
there
are
currently
just
11
400
service
stations
each
serving
an
average
of
more
than
3
000
vehicles

Cash
dividends
on
A

will
be
subject
to
the
deduction
of
Dutch
dividend
withholding
tax
at
the
rate
of
15
which
may
be
reduced
in
certain
circumstances
Based
on
a
policy
statement
issued
by
the
Dutch
Ministry
of
Finance
on
April
29
2016
which
has
been
formalised
in
law
with
effect
from
January
2017
and
depending
on
their
particular
circumstances
non-Dutch
resident
shareholders
may
be
entitled
to
a
full
or
partial
refund
of
Dutch
dividend
withholding
tax
As
from
2018
Dutch
and
non-Dutch
resident
shareholders
who
are
exempt
from
corporate
income
tax
may
elect
for
an
exemption
from
Dutch
dividend
withholding
tax
instead
of
requesting
a
refund
if
tax
was
withheld
Furthermore
in
April
2016
there
were
changes
to
the
UK
taxation
of
dividends
The
dividend
tax
credit
was
abolished
and
a
new
tax
free
dividend
allowance
introduced
Dividend
income
in
excess
of
the
allowance
is
taxable
at
the
following
rates
7
5
within
the
basic
rate
band
32
5
within
the
higher
rate
band
and
38
1
on
dividend
income
taxable
at
the
additional
rate
If
you
are
uncertain
as
to
the
tax
treatment
of
any
dividends
you
should
consult
your
own

that
will
see
a
488
metre
long
floating
facility
extracting
and
liquefying
gas
at

before
it
is
exported
to

located
approximately
475km
north-north

Australia
Shell
Australia
Chairman
Zoe
Yujnovich
said
the
arrival
of
the
Prelude
FLNG
facility
signalled
a
new
era
for
the
Australian
LNG
export
industry
with
the
first
floating
liquefaction
facility
deployed
in
local

Prelude
s
arrival
is
a
clear
demonstration
of
Shell
s
long
standing
commitment
to
investment
and
development
in
Australia
–
delivering
significant
economic
benefits
to
the
nation
Ms
Yujnovich
said
Shell
had
awarded
a
majority
of
Prelude
contracts
to
Australian
contractors
including
the
contract
awarded
to
Australian
engineering
company
Monadelphous
for
maintenance
and
modification
services
valued
at
200
million
Prelude
is
an
Australian

Shell
has
recognised
how
important
it
is
to
build
strong
partnerships
with
Australian
industry
she
said
To
develop
and
maintain
a
safe
high
performance
culture
on
the
facility
Shell
has
partnered
with
South
Metropolitan
TAFE
in
Western
Australia
to
develop
specific
training
for
Prelude
technicians
One
hundred
and
fifty
technicians
have
been
trained
across
a
broad
range
of
critical
skills
including
helicopter
landing
and
refuelling
skills
rigging
scaffolding
and

today
confirmed
that
its
Prelude
floating
liquefied
natural
gas
FLNG
facility
has
arrived
in
Australian

of
947m
830m
and
additional
payments
of
up
to
285m
250m
between
2018-2025
subject
to

The
transaction
which
represents
Shell
s
exit
from
the
upstream
business
in
Ireland
is
subject
to
partner
and
regulatory
consents
and
is
expected
to
complete
in
Q2
2018
The
transaction
s
effective
date
is
January
1
2017
The
Shell
share
of
the

Europe
Limited
"SEEL"
has
signed
an

part
of
our
strategy
to
reshape

and
to
deliver
a
world
class

case
said
Shell

Upstream
Director
Andy
Brown
It
demonstrates
the
strong
momentum
behind
our
three-year
30
billion
divestment
programme
At
the
half-way
point
we
have
now
announced
deals
valued
at
more
than
20
billion
This
transaction
is
consistent
with
Shell
s
strategy
to
concentrate
our
Upstream
footprint
where
we
can
add
most
value
I
m
confident
that
Corrib
will
continue
to
deliver
energy
successfully
to
the

our
staff

and
the

who
have
worked

With
our

remaining
with
the
asset
-
CPPIB
as
a

and
Vermilion
as
the

Royal
Dutch
Shell
plc
will
release
its
second
quarter
results
and
second
quarter
interim
dividend
announcement
for
2017
The
TCFD
is
a
global
initiative
chaired
by
Michael
Bloomberg
to
get
companies
across
all
sectors
to
assess
more
clearly
and
disclose
more
transparently
both
the
risks
and
the
opportunities
presented
by
climate
change
It
was
set
up
at
the
prompting
of
the
G20
and
the
Financial
Stability
Board
FSB
I
agree
that
companies
should
be
clear
about
how
they
plan
to
be
resilient
in
the
face
of
climate
change
and
energy
transition
said
Shell
CEO
Ben
van
Beurden
I
believe
it
is
right
that
it
should
be
transparent
which
companies
are
truly
on
firm
foundations
over
the
long-term
I
applaud
the
task
force
for
its
work
to
achieve
this
aim
and
I
have
signed
a
letter
confirming
Shell
s
support
for
the
initiative
The
details
matter
and
I
look
forward
to
Shell
working
with
the
task
force
on
those
details
Specifically
how
we
present
forward-looking
information
in
an
uncertain
world
the
disclosure
of
commercially
sensitive
data
and
the
feasibility
of
providing
the
suggested
detail
to
the
standard
required
of
financial
filings
Ultimately
however
both
Shell
and
the
task
force
want
these
disclosures
to
be
fit
for
purpose
Commenting
on
Shell
s
support
for
the
initiative
Governor
of
the
Bank
of
England
and
FSB
Chair
Mark
Carney
said
The
task
force
s
recommendations
have
been
developed
by
the
market
for
the
market
They
set
out
the
disclosures
that
a
wide
range
of
users
and
preparers
of
corporate
information
have
said
are
essential
to
understanding
a
company
s
climate-related
risks
and
opportunities
Widespread
adoption
will
provide
investors
banks
and
insurers
with
that
information
helping
minimise
the
risk
that
market
adjustments
to
climate
change
will
be
incomplete
late
and
potentially
destabilising
I
am
delighted
that
Shell
is
supporting
the
recommendations
and
that
in
so
doing
it
will
bring
its
considerable
expertise
to
work
with
the
task
force
to
build
on
and
refine
their
recommendations
over
time

LNG
bunkering
provides
the
shipping
industry
with
a
new
fuel
that
helps
meet
the
industry
s
environmental
and
economic
objectives
Increasing
numbers
of
ship
owners
and
operators
are
turning
to
LNG
over
traditional
marine
fuels
in
response
to
tighter
sulfur
and
nitrogen
oxide
emissions
regulations
In
October
2016
the
International
Maritime
Organization
IMO
announced
the
introduction
of
a
global
0

sulfur
cap
from
2020
Commenting
on
the
occasion
Mr
Saad
Sherida
Al-Kaabi
Qatar
Petroleum
s
President
and
CEO
said
We
are
pleased
to
team
up
with
our
long-term
partner
and
industry
pioneer
Shell
on
this
important
initiative
We
view
LNG
bunkering
as
a
promising
opportunity
for
LNG
to
further
grow
as
a
clean
energy
source
Mr
Al-Kaabi
added
LNG
demand
for
bunkering
is
expected
to
increase
significantly
over
the
coming
years
and
we
believe
there
is
real
potential
for
such
demand
to
reach
up
to
50
million
tons
per
annum
by
2030
Obviously
achieving
this
figure
requires
focused
investments
and
the
right
partnership
model
similar
to
the
one
we
are
establishing
today
On
his
part
Mr
Ben
van
Beurden
Shell
s
Chief
Executive
Officer
said
As
two
of
the
world
s
leading

suppliers
Shell

have
the
capability

to
ship
owners
and
operators
who
must
meet
tougher

from

We
look

to
working
with
Qatar

to
increase
the

In
his
introduction
Shell
s
Chief
Executive
Officer
Ben
van
Beurden
said
In
2016
the
world
took
significant
steps
towards
building
a
low-carbon
energy
future
The
United
Nations
UN
Paris
Agreement
and
the
UN's
sustainable
development
goals
came
into
force
setting
new
targets
for
tackling
climate
change
promoting
sustainable
economic
growth
and
providing
access
to
modern
energy
It
was
also
a
significant
year
for
Shell
Against
a
backdrop
of
low
oil
prices
we
acquired
BG
which
added
to
our
operations
and
opportunities
in
natural
gas
the
cleanest-burning
hydrocarbon
and
in
deep
water
As
part
of
a
refreshed
business
strategy
we
set
long-term
environmental
and
social
ambitions
to
reduce
our
carbon
intensity
and
to
deliver
shared
value
for
society
This

Director
said
This
sale
supports
Shell
s
strategic
commitment
to
focus
Downstream
activities
on
areas
where
we
can
be
most
competitive
This
is
one
of
the
last
of
our
wholly
owned
LPG
businesses
and
this
sale
is
another
step
in
Shell
s
ongoing
portfolio
optimisation
strategy
to
deliver
30
billion
of
divestments
between
2016
and
2018
Hong
Kong
and
Macau
remain
important
markets
for
Shell
and
this
sale
does
not
have
any
impact
on
the
company
s
other
businesses
As
part
of
the
sale
Shell
will
be
entering
into
a
long-term
brand
license
agreement
with
DCC
Energy
that
will
ensure
the
Shell
brand
remains
visible
across
the
LPG
business
in
Hong
Kong
and
Macau
All
local
Shell
LPG
employees
affected
will
be
given
an
option
to
transition
to
DCC
Energy
The
sale
is
expected
to
conclude
in
Q1
2018
subject
to
the
receipt
of
relevant
regulatory

more
than
just
making
balanced
investments
Collaboration
across
different
disciplines
and
with
other
sectors
externally
is
a
key
enabler
of
successful
innovation
And
collaboration
is
essential
to
meet
our
biggest
challenge
timely
development
and
deployment
of
the
best

we
have
built
in

over
the
past
55
years
The
decision
to
divest

not
taken
lightly

it
is
consistent
with
Shell
s
strategy
to
concentrate
our
Upstream
footprint
where
we
can
be

added
Together
with
recent
divestments
in
the
UK
Gulf
of

and
Canada
this
transaction
shows
the
clear
momentum
behind
Shell

it
helps
us
to
high-grade

simplify
our

published
its
Annual
Report
and
Form
20-F
for
the
year
ended
December
31
2016
Under
the
first
agreement
Shell
will
sell
to
a
subsidiary
of
Canadian
Natural
Resources
Limited
Canadian
Natural
its
entire
60
percent
interest
in
AOSP
its
100
percent
interest
in
the
Peace
River
Complex
in-situ
assets
including
Carmon
Creek
and
a
number
of
undeveloped
oil
sands
leases
in
Alberta
Canada
The
consideration
to
Shell
from
Canadian
Natural
is
approximately
8
5
billion
C
11
1
billion
comprised
of
5
4
billion
in
cash
plus
around
98
million
Canadian
Natural
shares
currently
valued
at
3
1
billion
Canadian
Natural
is
one
of
Canada
s
largest
energy
companies
and
a
leader
in
the
oil
sands
with
a
market
capitalisation
of
approximately
35
billion
C
46
billion
Separately
and
under
the
second
agreement
Shell
and
Canadian
Natural
will
jointly
acquire
and
own
equally
Marathon
Oil
Canada
Corporation
MOCC
which
holds
a
20
percent
interest
in
AOSP
from
an
affiliate
of
Marathon
Oil
Corporation
for
1
25
billion
each
to
be
settled
in
cash
The
combination
of
these
transactions
will
result
in
a
net
consideration
of
7
25
billion
to
Shell
On
completion
of
all
transactions
listed
above
it
is
envisaged
that
Canadian
Natural
will
be
the
operator
of
the
AOSP
upstream
mining
assets
and
Shell
will
continue
as
operator
of
the
Scotford
upgrader
and
Quest
CCS
project
located
next
to
the
100
percent
Shell-affiliate
owned
Scotford
refinery
and
chemicals
plants
This
arrangement
is
expected
to
allow
Shell
to
maximise
value
in
its
competitive
Canadian
Downstream
business
and
leverage
proprietary
technology
The
transactions
are
expected
to
close
mid-2017
subject
to
customary
closing
conditions
and
adjustments
and
regulatory
approvals
Shell
Chief
Executive
Officer
Ben
van
Beurden
said
This
announcement
is
a
significant
step
in
re-shaping
Shell
s
portfolio
in
line
with
our
long-term
strategy
We
are
strengthening
Shell
s
world-class
investment
case
by
focusing
on
free
cash
flow
and
higher
returns
on
capital
and
prioritising
businesses
where
we
have
global
scale
and
a
competitive
advantage
such
as
Integrated
Gas
and
deep
water
The
proceeds
will
accelerate
free
cash
flow
and
reduce
gearing
and
make
a
meaningful
contribution
to
Shell
s
30
billion
divestment
programme
Shell
Canada
President
and
Country
Chair
Michael
Crothers
said
We
are
very
proud
of
the
oil
sands
and
in-situ
operations
that
our
people
have
grown
in
Alberta
over
the
past
several
decades
These
assets
are
an
excellent
fit
for
Canadian
Natural
a
highly
experienced
oil
sands
developer
Shell
has
been
in
Canada
for
more
than
100
years
and
we
plan
to
continue
our
presence
as
one
of
the
country
s
largest
integrated
energy
companies
We
are
enhancing
returns
in
our
important
Downstream
business
and
leveraging
our
world-class
manufacturing
capabilities
through
the
integration
opportunities
that
come
with
continuing
to
operate
the
Scotford
upgrader
and
Quest
CCS
project
located
next
to
the
Shell
Scotford
refinery
and
chemicals
plants
In
addition
to
the
cash
proceeds
and
Canadian
Natural
shares
the
divestment
includes
additional
intellectual
property
agreements
valued
at
up
to
285
million
and
a
long-term
supply
agreement
for
the
Scotford
refinery
The
transactions
will
potentially
allow
for
additional
cost
reductions
and
continued
value
chain
optimisation
for
Shell
The
transactions
constitute
a
Class
2
transaction
for
the
purposes
of
the
UK
Financial
Conduct
Authority's
Listing
Rules
The
net
cash
proceeds
received
from
these
transactions
will
be
used
to
pay
down
debt
In
the
full
year
2016
the
assets
being
divested
to
Canadian
Natural
recorded
profits
before
tax
of
negative
22
million
with
upstream
production
averaging
around
160
thousand
barrels
per
day
For
the
year
ended
31
December
2016
reserves
associated
with
the
assets
being
divested
to
Canadian
Natural
were
2
billion
barrels
and
the
gross
assets
at
that
date
were
approximately
12
billion
The
transactions
are
estimated
to
result
in
a
post-tax
impairment
of
1
3
to
1
5
billion
subject
to
adjustments
Shell
s
share
position
in
Canadian
Natural
will
be
managed
for
value
realization
over
time
Shell
and
Canadian
Natural
have
agreed
that
subject
to
closing
of
the
transactions
and
additional
further
conditions
Shell
may
swap
its
50
percent
purchased
interest
of
MOCC
for
a
20
percent
interest
in
assets
of
the
Scotford
upgrader
and
Quest
CCS
project
If
the
swap
were
to
occur
Shell
would
fully
exit
AOSP
s
mining
operations
and
hold
a
20
percent
interest
in
the
Scotford
upgrader
and
Quest

project
Shell
retains
significant
operations
in

Many
expected
a
strong
increase
in
new
LNG
supplies
would
outpace
demand
growth
during
2016
Instead
demand
growth
kept
pace
with
supply
as
greater
than
expected
demand
in
Asia
and
the
Middle
East
absorbed
the
increase
in
supply
from
Australia
according

LNG
Outlook
Global
LNG
trade
demonstrated
its
flexibility
time
and
again
in
2016
responding
to
shortfalls
in
national
and
regional
gas
supply
and
to
new
emerging
demand
said
Maarten
Wetselaar
Integrated
Gas
and
New
Energies
Director
at
Shell
The
outlook
for
LNG
demand
is
set
to
grow
at
twice
the
rate
of
gas
demand
at
4
to
5
a
year
between
2015
and
2030
China
and
India
–
which
are
set
to
continue
driving
a
rise
in
demand
–
were
two
of
the
fastest
growing
buyers
increasing
their
imports
by
a
combined
11
9
MT
of
LNG
in
2016
This
boosted
China
s
LNG
imports
in
2016
to
27
MT
and
India
s
to
20
MT
Total
global
LNG
demand
increased
following
the
addition
of
six
new
importing
countries
since
2015
Colombia
Egypt
Jamaica
Jordan
Pakistan
and
Poland
They
brought
the
number
of
LNG
importers
to
35
up
from
around
10
at
the
start
of
this
century
Egypt
Jordan
and
Pakistan
were
among
the
fastest
growing
LNG
importers
in
the
world
in
2016
Due
to
local
shortages
in
gas
supplies
they
imported
13
9
MT
of
LNG
in
total
The
bulk
of
growth
in
LNG
exports
in
2016
came
from
Australia
where
exports
increased
by
15
MT
to
a
total
of
44
3
MT
It
was
also
a
significant
year
for
the
USA
after
2
9
MT
of
LNG
was
delivered
from
the
Sabine
Pass
terminal
in
Louisiana
LNG
prices
are
expected
to
continue
to
be
determined
by
multiple
factors
including
oil
prices
global
LNG
supply
and
demand
dynamics
and
the
costs
of
new
LNG
facilities
In
addition
the
growth
of
LNG
trade
has
evolved
into
helping
meet
demand
when
domestic
gas
markets
face
supply
shortages
LNG
trade
also
is
changing
to
meet
the
needs
of
buyers
including
shorter-term
and
lower-volume
contracts
with
greater
degrees
of
flexibility
Some
emerging
LNG
buyers
have
more
challenging
credit
ratings
than
traditional
buyers
While
the
industry
has
been
flexible
in
developing
new
demand
there
has
been
a
decrease
in
final
investment
decisions
for
new
supply
Shell
believes
further
investments
will
need
to
be
made
by
the
industry
to
meet
growing
demand
most
of
which
is
set
to
come
from
Asia
after
2020
In
China
a
government
target
has
been
set
for
gas
to
make
up
15
of
the
country
s
energy
mix
by
2030
up
from

Meanwhile
Southeast
Asia
is
projected
to

net
importer
of

by

will
require
consultation
with
and
support
of
the

body
established
under
the
OSPAR
Convention
to

to
deal
with
the

Following
conclusion
of
the
public
consultation
period
the
recommendations
will
be
considered
by
BEIS
alongside
consultation
responses
Providing

the
Greater

Erskine
plus
a
10

in

Based
on
the
initial
consideration
received
Shell
expects
to
record
an
accounting
gain
on
sale
against
the
values
of
both
the
Shell
and
former
BG
assets
included
in
the
package
The
decommissioning
costs
associated
with
the
package
are
currently
expected
to
be
3
9bn
of
which
Shell
will
retain
a
fixed
liability
of
1bn
and
Chrysaor
will
assume
the
remaining
liability
The
deal
is
subject
to
partner
and
regulatory
approvals
with
completion
expected
in
the
second
half
of

The

Following
completion
Shell
will
retain

more

in
the

Sea
with
production
from
the
Schiehallion

are
expected
to
transfer
to

subject
to
a
detailed
scoping
exercise

staff
consultation
on
their
existing
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
Andy
Brown
Shell
s
Upstream
Director
said
Shell
has
a
long
and
proud
history
in
the
UK
North
Sea
to
which
we
remain
committed
This
deal
complements
the
great
strides
we
have
made
over
the
last
two
years
in
improving
the
competitiveness
of
our
UK
upstream
business
We
believe
this
deal
is
a
vote
of
confidence
in
the
UK
North
Sea
and
offers
proof
that
the
industry
s
increasing
competitiveness
and
improvements
to
the
fiscal
and
regulatory
regime
are
starting
to
produce
positive
results
It
will
deliver
value
to
Shell
Chrysaor
and
the
UK
as
a
whole
enabling
us
to
continue
to
strengthen
and
optimise
our
UK
portfolio
and
providing
a
springboard
for
Chrysaor
to
bring
new
investment
and
growth
into
the
basin
It
also
contributes
to
the
UK
s
goal
of
maximising
economic
recovery
of
oil
and
gas
from
the
UK
North
Sea
which
will
continue
to
be
a
source
of
energy
and
revenue
for
the
country
for
many
years
to
come
Simon
Henry
Shell
s
Chief
Financial
Officer
said
This
deal
shows
the
clear
momentum
behind
Shell
s
global
value-driven
30bn
divestment
programme
It
builds
on
recent
upstream
divestments
in
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
and
Canada
It
is
also
consistent
with
Shell
s
strategy
to
high-grade
and
simplify
our
portfolio
following
the
acquisition
of
BG
to
ensure
the
company
represents
a
world-class
investment
case
Importantly
the
value
here
represents
a
profit
against
the
book

of
the
assets

announcement
for

The
Shell
makethefuture
campaign
is
highlighting
the
need
for
greater
global
collaboration
to
create
more
and
cleaner
energy
solutions
by
helping
to
bring
to
life
innovations
from
six
smart
energy
start-ups
Technologies
from
the
bright
energy
businesses
will
be
showcased
in
Rio
de
Janeiro
s
Santa
Marta
community
this
month
before
they
are
installed
in
communities
that
require
urgent
access
to
cleaner
energy
The
entrepreneurs
innovations
are
being
brought
together
in
Santa
Marta
as
it
is
benefitting
from
an
installation
by
Insolar
a
solar
energy
start-up
that
is
one
of
the
featured
entrepreneurs
being
supported
by
Shell
Insolar
is
fitting
photovoltaic
panels
to
some
of
Santa
Marta
s
most
widely
used
community
centres
including
a
samba
school
and
crèche
which
are
central
to
the
life
of
the
community
s
8
000
residents
Young
Brazilian
entrepreneur
Henrique
Drumond
who
founded
Insolar
sees
the
project
as
a
significant
step
in
his
mission
to
help
to
bring
cleaner
energy
to
Brazil
where
solar
accounts
for
only
0
02
per
cent
of
the
energy
mix
with
only
1
731
small-scale
solar
systems
connected
to
its
grid
–
despite
more
than
2
000
hours
of
sunlight
blazing
on
the
country
each
year
In
Rio
alone
an
estimated
1
4
million
residents
of
the
city
s
763
favelas
are
affected
by
rising
energy
prices
and
unreliable
power
supply
The
Insolar
installation
is
expected
to
generate
the
equivalent
of
185
000
days
of
free
clean
power
over
the
lifetime
of

event
of
a
severe
storm

Shell
today
announced
a
new
exploration
discovery
in
the
deep
water
U
S
Gulf
of
Mexico
The
initial
estimated
recoverable
resources
for
the
Fort
Sumter
well
are
more
than
125
million
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
boe
Further
appraisal
drilling
and
planned
wells
in
adjacent
structures
could
considerably
increase
recoverable
potential
in
the
vicinity
of
the
Fort
Sumter
well
The
Fort
Sumter
discovery
builds
upon
Shell
s
global
deep-water
leadership
Its
proximity
to
our
nearby
discoveries
in
the
area
and
to
highly
prospective
acreage
to
the
southeast
makes
Fort
Sumter
particularly
significant
said
Ceri
Powell
Executive
Vice
President
Exploration
These
successes
demonstrate
there
is
still
running
room
in
the
producing
basins
of
our
heartlands
where
large
high-value
discoveries
have
the
potential
to
further
strengthen
our
deep-water
competitiveness
Fort
Sumter
was
safely
drilled
in
the
Mississippi
Canyon
Block
566
located
approximately
73
miles
117

remains
a

–
it

strong
stakeholder

support

achieved
critical
regulatory
approvals
has
important
commercial

has
received
necessary
environmental
approvals
and
First
Nations
support
along
the

right-of-way
Our
project
has
benefitted
from
the
overwhelming
support
of
the
BC
Government
First
Nations
–
in
particular
the
Haisla
and
the
Kitimat
community
We
could
not
have
advanced
the
project
thus
far
without
it
I
can
t
say
enough
about
how
valuable
this
support
has
been
and
how
important
it

be

Through
their

build
a
strong
LNG
sector
for
Canada
and
a
critical
cleaner
energy
alternative
for
the
world
the
governments
of
British
Columbia
and
Canada
have
developed
sound
fiscal
and
regulatory
frameworks
for
success
However
in
the
context
of
global
industry
challenges
including
capital
constraints
the
LNG
Canada
Joint
Venture
participants
have
determined
they
need
more
time
prior
to
taking
a
final
investment
decision
At
this
time
we
cannot
confirm
when
this
decision
will
be
made
In
the
coming
weeks
LNG

will
continue
key
site
preparation
activities
and
work
with
its

spending
the
last
12
months
designing
building
and
testing
their
energy-efficient
vehicles
to
compete
on
a
specially-built
2

urban
track
to
see
whose
vehicle
could
travel
furthest

The

today
announced
the
pounds

and
euro
equivalent
dividend
payments
in
respect
of
the

The
complex
will
use
low-cost
ethane
from
shale
gas
producers
in
the
Marcellus
and
Utica
basins
to
produce
1
6
million
tonnes
of
polyethylene
per
year
Polyethylene
is
used
in
many
products
from
food
packaging
and
containers
to
automotive
components
The
facility
will
be
built
on
the
banks
of
the
Ohio
River
in
Potter
Township
Beaver
County
about
30
miles
north-west
of
Pittsburgh
As
a
result
of
its
close
proximity
to
gas
feedstock
the
complex
and
its
customers
will
benefit
from
shorter
and
more
dependable
supply
chains
compared
to
supply
from
the
Gulf
Coast
The
location
is
also
ideal
because
more
than
70
of
North
American
polyethylene
customers
are
within
a
700-mile
radius
of
Pittsburgh
The
project
will
bring
new
growth
and
jobs
to
the
region
with
up
to
6
000
construction
workers
involved
in

Shell
has
taken
the
final
investment
decision
to
build
a
major
petrochemical
complex
comprising
an
ethylene
cracker
with
polyethylene

unit
near
Pittsburgh

Main
construction
will

expected
to
begin
early
in
the
next
decade
Shell
Chief
Executive
Officer
Ben
van
Beurden
today
provided
an
update
on
the
company
s
strategy
that
sets
a
clear
course
for
stronger
returns
and
free
cash
flow
Setting
his
remarks
in
the
context
of
a
volatile
industry
backdrop
van
Beurden
said
I
see
important
opportunities
for
Shell
from
the
substantial
and
lasting
changes
underway
in
the
energy
sector
We
expect
to
see
robust
demand
for
oil
and
gas
for
decades
to
come
in
a
global
energy
system
in
a
long-term
transition
to
lower
carbon
fuels
As
well
as
low
oil
prices
today
we
are
seeing
higher
levels
of
price
volatility
due
to
geopolitical
change
the
speed
of
information
flows
and
the
pace
of
innovation
in
our
sector
By
capping
our
capital
spending
in
the
period
to
2020
investing
in
compelling
projects
driving
down
costs
and
selling
non-core
positions
we
can
reshape
Shell
into
a
more
focussed
and
more
resilient
company
with
better
returns
and
growing
free
cash
flow
per
share
All
of
this
is
underpinned
by
an
unrelenting
focus
on
safe
and
environmentally-responsible
operational
performance
high
quality
and
commercial
project
execution
and
prudent
financial
management
of
the
company
Turning
to
the
recent
acquisition
of
BG
van
Beurden
said
The
BG
deal
is
an
opportunity
to
accelerate
the
re-shaping
of
Shell
Integration
is
gathering
pace
and
today
we
expect
to
deliver
more
synergies
and
at
a
faster
rate
We
are
announcing
an
increase
in
expected
deal-related
synergies
from
the
3
5
billion
set
out
in
the
prospectus
to
4
5
billion
on
a
pre-tax
basis
in
2018
an
increase
of
some
30
We
expect
to
achieve
and
exceed
the
3
5
billion
synergies
prospectus
commitment
earlier
than
expected
in
2017
when
synergies
should
be
4
billion
Our
other
deal-related
financial
commitments
to
shareholders
in
the
form
of
asset
sales
debt
reduction
and
dividends
followed
by
share
buy-backs
are
unchanged
Van
Beurden
added
With
our
continued
strong
focus
on
returns
and
growth
in
free
cash
flow
per
share
I
want
to
create
a
world-class
investment
case
for
Shell
shareholders
Van
Beurden
went
on
to
set
out
Shell
s
portfolio
priorities
which
have
been
revised
to
drive
an
improvement
in
returns
and
free
cash
flow
Van
Beurden
defined
three
categories
that
play
out
across
different
time
scales
Cash
engines
conventional
oil
and
gas
integrated
gas
oil
sands
mining
and
oil
products
Cash
engines
are
stable
businesses
which
underpin
the
financial
delivery
of
the
company
today
They
should
have
strong
and
resilient
returns
and
free
cash
flow
to
fund
dividends
and
the
balance
sheet
well
into
the
next
decade
and
beyond
We
continue
to
invest
in
selective
growth
opportunities
in
these
businesses
at
a
level
that
enables
positive
free
cash
flow
throughout
the
macro
cycle
Through-cycle
returns
here
should
be
attractive
and
competitive
Integrated
gas
which
was
previously
a
growth
priority
for
Shell
has
reached
critical
mass
following
the
BG
acquisition
and
planned
growth
in
liquefied
natural
gas
LNG
particularly
in
Australia
The
pace
of
new
investment
will
slow
here
and
integrated
gas
will
now
prioritise
the
generation
of
free
cash
flow
and
returns
Growth
priorities
deep
water
and
chemicals
Shell
has
advantaged
positions
and
affordable
growth
plans
here
which
should
create
a
pathway
to
improved
returns
and
material
free
cash
flow
from
around
2020
as
these
businesses
become
new
cash
engines
We
give
priority
to
growth
projects
in
these
businesses
such
that
free
cash
flow
may
be
negative
at
the
lower
end
of
the
cycle
Returns
should
improve
over
the
next
3-5
years
Brazil
and
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
represent
the
best
real
estate
in
global
deep
water
We
are
developing
competitive
projects
here
based
on
this
advantaged
acreage
Shell
s
deep-water
production
could
double
to
some
900
thousand
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
per
day
kboed
in
2020
compared
with
450
kboed
in
2015
In
Chemicals
the
company
already
has
brownfield
growth
projects
underway
on
the
US
Gulf
Coast
and
in
China
Today
we
are
announcing
the
final
investment
decision
on
a
new
1
5
million
tonnes
per
annum
mtpa
cracker
and
polyethylene
plant
in
Pennsylvania
USA
which
will
use
natural
gas
from
shales
production
as
its
feedstock
Once
these
projects
are
on
stream
early
in
the
next
decade
Shell
s
ethylene
capacity
should
reach
around
8
mtpa
compared
with
6
2
mtpa
today
Future
opportunities
shales
and
new
energies
These
businesses
are
expected
to
become
significant
growth
priorities
for
Shell
beyond
2020
as
we
establish
clear
pathways
to
profitability
They
are
themes
with
material
value
and
upside
potential
to
deliver
returns
for
Shell
shareholders
Investment
here
remains
relatively
low
focused
on
current
positions
and
identifying
potential
opportunities
Free
cash
flow
will
likely
be
negative
and
returns
low
for
some
time
Capital
employed
here
is
constrained
until
attractive
opportunities
are
developed
In
shales
Shell
s
restructured
portfolio
is
focused
on
North
America
and
Argentina
with
substantial
long-term
growth
potential
In
new
energies
there
is
potential
for
Shell
to
achieve
material
scale
and
profitability
As
the
energy
transition
unfolds
we
intend
to
establish
a
portfolio
to
build
on
our
established
strengths
in
low-carbon
biofuels
hydrogen
and
smart
customer
solutions
as
well
as
in
solar
and
wind
Many
of
these
activities
complement
the
company
s
natural
gas
strategy
today
Overall
Shell
s
focus
is
on
re-shaping
the
company
We
will
retain
the
most
competitive
and
resilient
positions
through
targeted
investment
and
substantial

This
is
a
value-driven
not
time-driven
divestment
programme
and
an
integral
element
of
Shell
s
portfolio
improvement
plan
Updating
our
financial
outlook
Following
the
BG
acquisition
and
as
expected
Shell
s
balance
sheet
gearing
increased
to
26
at
the
end
of
Q1
2016
from
14
at
the
end
of
2015
Shell
s
priorities
for
cash
flow
as
announced
with
the
BG
acquisition
are
unchanged
1
reduce
debt
2
pay
dividends
and
3
a
balance
between
capital
investment
and
share
buy-backs
Our
free
cash
flow
is
being
reduced
due
to
low
oil
prices
and
this
could
continue
for
some
time
In
response
Shell
is
pulling
four
levers
to
manage
the
financial
framework
in
the
down-cycle
Capital
investment
will
be
in
the
range
of
25-
30
billion
each
year
to
2020
as
we
improve
capital
efficiency
and
ensure
a
more
predictable
development
funnel
for
new
projects
Investment
for
2016
is
expected
to
be
29
billion
excluding
the
purchase
price
of
BG
some
35
lower
than
the
pro-forma
Shell-plus-BG
level
in
2014
In
the
prevailing
low
oil
price
environment
we
will
continue
to
drive
capital
spending
down
towards
the
bottom
end
of
this
range
or
even
lower
if
needed
In
a
higher
oil
price
future
we
intend
to
cap
our
spending
at
the
top
end
of
the
range
New
project
start-ups
since
end-2014
should
contribute
some
10
billion
of
annual
cash
flow
by
2018
Investment
delivers
new
profitable
projects
for
shareholders
Programmes
to
sustainably
reduce
operating
costs
are
in
place
across
the
company
we
expect
to
reach
a
run-rate
of
40
billion
of
underlying
operating
costs
at
the
end
of
2016
some
20
lower
than
the
2014
pro-forma
level
for
Shell-plus-BG
with
potential
for
further
cost
reduction
Asset
sales
as
planned
are
expected
to
be
30
billion
for
2016-18
We
have
earmarked
up
to
10
of
Shell
s
oil
and
gas
production
including
5
to
10
country
exits
for
disposal
We
expect
to
make
significant
progress
on
the
first
6-8
billion
of
this
programme
in
2016
As
a
result
of
Shell
s
portfolio
development
and
investment
we
expect
to
see
an
improvement
in
returns
in
the
next
few
years
our
debt
reduced
and
significant
growth
in
free
cash
flow
across
a
range
of
oil
prices
For
example
organic
free
cash
flow
could
reach
20-
25
billion
and
return
on
capital
employed
some
10
around
the
end
of
the
decade
assuming
60
oil
prices
This
compares
to
2013-15
averages
of
12
billion
and
8
with
average
90
oil
prices
Van
Beurden
concluded
Our
strategy
should
lead
to
a
simpler
company
with
fundamentally
advantaged
positions
and
fundamentally
lower
capital
intensity

contribution

This
includes
a
continued
focus
on

carbon
capture
and
storage
and
biofuels
as
well
as
other
investments
in
low-carbon

such
as

as

In
his
introduction
to
the
Sustainability

Shell
s
Chief
Executive
Officer
Ben
van
Beurden
said
It
was
a
significant
year
for
the
global
community
in
2015
with
the
adoption
of
the
historic
Paris
Agreement
by
195
countries
demonstrating
a
commitment
to
bring
about
a
lower-carbon
energy
system
I
believe
that
greater
co-operation
across
society
is
needed
for
a
successful
energy
transition
More
cross-sector
coalitions
–
where
business
government
and
civil
society
work
effectively
together
–
will
accelerate

said
I
m
pleased
to
confirm
that
we
are
going
ahead
with
this
growth
project
We
are
selective
in
our
investments
and
this
decision
underlines
our
confidence
in
the
strong
growth
potential
for
chemicals
in
China
It
will
position
Shell
and
our
partner
CNOOC
well
to
help
meet
the
growing
needs
of
customers
in
this
expanding
petrochemicals
market
The
expansion
of
the
Nanhai
petrochemical
complex
supports
the
Chinese
long-term
petrochemicals
development
plan
and
mixed
ownership
reform
direction
We
re
delighted
that
Shell
will
contribute
to
the
project
and
our
joint
venture
with
industry-leading
technology
with
improved
value
through
integration
with
nearby
CNOOC
refineries
to
produce
high
quality
petrochemicals
for
China
s
growing
domestic
markets

Shell
will
apply
its
proprietary

150
000
tonnes
per
annum
tpa
of
ethylene
oxide
480
000
tpa
of
ethylene
glycol
and
600
000
tpa
of
high
quality
polyols
This
increases
the
volumes
and
diversity
of
CSPC
s
high
quality
product
range
to
around
2
million
tonnes
per
year
as
well
as
enhances
overall
energy
efficiency
It
will
be
the
first
time
that
Shell
s
industry-leading
OMEGA
and
advanced
polyols
technologies
will
be
applied
in
China
The
CSPC
site
which
has
a
strong
track
record
of
reliable
and
safe
operations
currently
converts
a
variety
of
liquid
feedstocks
into
olefins
and
derivative
products
These
are
used
in
a
wide
range
of
consumer
goods
including
computers
plastic

2015
between
the

"Motiva's
performance
has
been
transformed
in
the
last
two
years
We
propose
to
combine
the

we
will
retain
from
the
joint
venture
with
Shell's
other
Downstream
assets
in
North
America
This
is
consistent
with
both
the
Group
and
Downstream
strategy
to
provide
simpler
and
more
highly
integrated

have
had
a

and
the
Motiva
joint
venture
with
Shell
has
served
our
downstream
business
objectives
very
well
for
many
years
However
it
is
now
time
for
the
partners
to
pursue
their
independent
downstream

The
Port

Following
a
careful
and
thorough
evaluation
of
technical
challenges
and
costs
Shell
has
decided
to
exit
the
joint
development
of
the
Bab
sour
gas
reservoirs
with
ADNOC
in
the
emirate
of
Abu
Dhabi
and
to
stop
further
joint
work
on
the
project
The
evaluation
concluded
that
for
Shell
the
development
of
the
project
does
not
fit
with
the
company
s
strategy
particularly
in
the
economic
climate
prevailing
in

expected
to
produce
around
260

is
also
good

Mayo
through
a
20

Shell
is
publically
sharing
information
on
Quest's
design
and
processes
to
further
global
adoption
of
CCS
Quest
draws
on
techniques
used
by
the
energy
industry
for
decades
and
integrates
the
components
of
CCS
for
the
large-scale
capture
transport
and
storage
of
CO2
CCS
is
one
of
the
only
technologies
that
can
significantly
reduce
carbon
emissions
from
industrial
sectors
of
the
economy
Speaking
at
the
official

said
"Quest
represents

construction
and
use
of

CCS
technology
on
a
commercial

Quest
is
a

for
future
CCS
projects
globally
Together
with

we
are
sharing
the
know-how
to
help
make
CCS

more
accessible
and
cost-effective
for
the
energy
industry
and
other
key
industrial
sectors
of
the

Quest
will
capture
one-third
of
the

from
Shell
s
Scotford

which
turns
oil
sands

pipeline
and
injected
more
than
two

underground
below
multiple
layers
of
impermeable

Quest
is
now
operating
at

Shell
originally
sanctioned
the
project
in
October
2013
and
announced
in
March
2015
that
the
project
would
be
re-phased
to
take
advantage
of
the
market
downturn
to
optimise
design
and
retender
certain
contracts
After
careful
review
of
the
potential
design
options
updated
costs
and
the
company
s
capital
priorities
Shell
s
view
is
that
the
project
does
not
rank
in
its
portfolio
at
this
time
This
decision
reflects
current
uncertainties
including
the
lack
of
infrastructure
to
move
Canadian
crude
oil
to
global
commodity
markets
We
are
making
changes
to
Shell
s
portfolio
mix
by
reviewing
our
longer-term
upstream
options
world-wide
and
managing
affordability
and
exposure
in
the
current
world
of
lower
oil
prices
This
is
forcing
tough
choices
at
Shell
said
Chief
Executive
Officer
Ben
van
Beurden
Shell
will
retain
the
Carmon
Creek
leases
and
preserve
some

while
continuing
to

the
options
for
this
asset
The

expects
to
take
net
impairment
contract
provision
and
redundancy
and
restructuring
charges
of
some
2
billion
as
a
result

Germany
shows
what
we
can
achieve
through
close
collaboration
between

and

The
next
step
is
for
consumers
to
embrace
this
opportunity
and
consider
buying
hydrogen
vehicles
as
they
become
available
Shell
currently
operates
three
hydrogen
stations
in
Germany
including
one
in
Berlin
and
two
in
Hamburg
Shell
anticipates
the
first
four
new
fuelling
points
will
be
installed
at
existing
retail
sites
in
Frankfurt
Wuppertal
Geisingen
and
Wendingen
The
pumps
at
these
sites
will
refuel

vehicles
FCEV
in
a
few
minutes
The
cost
of
charging
a
hydrogen
fuel
cell
vehicle
is
comparable
to
filling
a
car
with
gasoline
or
diesel
and
they
can
travel
similar
distances
to
vehicles
with
conventional
combustion
engines
Shell
has
another
two
demonstration
hydrogen
filling
stations
in
Los
Angeles
that
allow
the
company
to
evaluate
a
range
of
technologies
drive
down
costs
and
better
understand
consumer
behaviour
The
company
is
assessing
the
potential
for
more
stations
in
the
USA

Shell
will
install
a
nationwide
network
of
hydrogen
fuelling
pumps
at
retail
sites
in
Germany
from
2016
in
an
effort
to
accelerate
the
growth
in
Europe
of
this
low-carbon
alternative

Andrew
Brown
Shell
s
Upstream
International
Director
said
This
new
start
up
is
another
important
milestone
for
Bonga
adding
valuable
new
production
to
this
major
facility
Bonga
Phase
3
is
an
expansion
of
the
Bonga
Main
development
with
peak
production
expected
to
be
some
50
000
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
This
will
be
transported
through
existing
pipelines
to
the
Bonga
floating
production
storage
and
offloading
FPSO
facility
which
has
the
capacity
to
produce
more
than
200
000
barrels
of
oil
and
150
million
standard
cubic
feet
of
gas
a
day
The
Bonga
field
which
began
producing
oil
and
gas
in
2005
was
Nigeria
s
first
deep-water
development
in
depths
of
more
than
1
000
metres
Bonga
has
produced
over
600
million
barrels
of
oil
to
date
The
Bonga
project
is
operated
by
SNEPCo
as
contractor
under
a
production
sharing
contract
with
the

agreement
in
December
2014
and
approval
from

Shell
has
found
indications
of
oil
and
gas
in
the
Burger
J
well
but
these
are
not
sufficient
to
warrant
further
exploration
in

"Shell
continues

see

the

likely
to
ultimately
be
of
strategic
importance

the

However
this
is
a
clearly
disappointing
exploration
outcome
for
this

Shell
will
now
cease

The
six
companies
set
out
their
position
in
a
joint
letter
from
their
chief
executives
to
the
UNFCCC
Executive
Secretary
and
the
President
of
the
COP21
This
comes
ahead
of
the
UNFCCC
s
COP21
climate
meetings
in
Paris
this
December
With
this
unprecedented
joint
initiative
the
companies
recognize
both
the
importance
of
the
climate
challenge
and
the
importance
of
energy
to
human
life
and
well-being
They
acknowledge
the
current
trend
of
greenhouse
gas
emissions
is
in
excess
of
what
the
Intergovernmental
Panel
on
Climate
Change
says
is
needed
to
limit
global
temperature
rise
to
no
more
than
2
degrees
Centigrade
and
say
they
are
ready
to
contribute
solutions
As
the
chief
executives
write
Our
industry
faces
a
challenge
we
need
to
meet
greater
energy
demand
with
less
CO2
We
are
ready
to
meet
that
challenge
and
we
are
prepared
to
play
our
part
We
firmly
believe
that
carbon
pricing
will
discourage
high
carbon
options
and
reduce
uncertainty
that
will
help
stimulate
investments
in
the
right
low
carbon
technologies
and
the
right
resources
at
the
right
pace
We
now
need
governments
around
the
world
to
provide
us
with
this
framework
and
we
believe
our
presence
at
the
table
will
be
helpful
in
designing
an
approach
that
will
be
both
practical
and
deliverable

David
Moss
Shell
s
Retail
General
Manager
North
Europe
said
I
m
pleased
these
dealers
have
chosen
to
grow
their
businesses
with
Shell
and
are
as
committed
as
we
are
to
delivering
high-quality
products
and
customer
service
Our
retail
business
is
going
from
strength
to
strength
with
record
sales
of
our
premium
fuel
Shell
V-Power
Nitro+
the
growth
of
our
popular
Deli2Go
food
and
beverage
range
and
our
new
relationship
with
PayPal
which
will
offer
mobile
payment
to
more
than
four
million
customers
a
week
The
185
service
stations
are
spread
across
Great
Britain
and
will
retain
the
Shell
brand
Dealers
will
continue
to
sell
Shell
s
high-quality
fuels
for
at
least
the
first
five
years
following
the
sale
Of
the
158
company
owned
sites
announced
today
90
have
been
purchased
by
Motor
Fuel
Group
and
68
by
Euro
Garages
Handover
of
these
service
stations
to
the
new
owners
will
be
completed
by
the
end
of
2015
Moss
added
Our
priority
is
to
ensure
that
a
consistently
excellent
customer
offer
is
available
across
our
network
whether
the
service
station
is
owned
by
Shell
or
by
an
independent
dealer
That
s
why
we
selected
these
independent
dealers
to
work
with
as
they
will
invest
in
the
sites
and
aim
to
deliver
the
same
high
standards
of
safety
and
customer
care
that
are
synonymous
with
the
Shell
brand
The
sale
of
185
Shell
service
stations
marks
the
end
of
a
commercial
process
which
began
in
September
2014
following
the
strategic
decision
to
reduce
the
number
of
Shell
company-owned
service
stations
to
around
550
and
expand
the
dealer
network
Notes
to

MFG
s
managing
director
Jeremy
Clarke
said
We
are
delighted
to
be
bringing
another
major
brand
to
the
MFG
network
This
acquisition
gives
us
90
high
volume
quality
stations
that
reinforce
our
commitment
to
become
one
of
the
most
dynamic
and
profitable
independent
forecourt
operators
in
the
UK
We
are
looking
forward
to
working
with
Shell
to
maximise
the
potential
of
these
sites
to
the
benefit
of
our
customers
Zuber
Issa
Chief
Executive
Euro
Garages
said
"We
look
forward
to
working
closely
and
extending
our
relationship
with
Shell
The
site
portfolio
secured
extends
our
UK
presence
and
consolidates
our
existing
forecourt
estate
As
a
result
more
customers
will
be
able
to
enjoy
our
branded
retail
convenience
offer
whilst
still
being
able
to
access

Qatar
Petroleum
and
Shell
have
decided
not
to
proceed
with
the
proposed
Al
Karaana
petrochemicals
project
and
to
stop
further
work
on
the
project
The
decision
came
after
a
careful
and
thorough
evaluation
of
commercial
quotations
from
EPC
engineering
procurement
and
construction
bidders
which
showed
high
capital
costs
rendering
it
commercially
unfeasible
particularly
in
the
current
economic
climate
prevailing
in
the
energy
industry
The
55
million
settlement
provides
for
an
individual
payment
to
each
claimant
who
accepts
the
settlement
agreement
in
compensation
for
losses
arising
from
the
spills
amounting
to
up
to
35
million
in
total
The
remaining
20
million
payment
will
be
made
for
the
benefit
of
the
Bodo
community
generally
From
the
outset
we
ve
accepted
responsibility
for
the
two
deeply
regrettable
operational
spills
in
Bodo
We
ve
always
wanted
to
compensate
the
community
fairly
and
we
are
pleased
to
have
reached
agreement
said
Mutiu
Sunmonu
Managing
Director
of
SPDC
We
are
fully
committed
to
the
clean-up
process
being
overseen
by
the
former
Netherlands
Ambassador
to
Nigeria
Despite
delays
caused
by
divisions
within
the
community
we
are
pleased
that
clean-up
work
will
soon
begin
now
that
a
plan
has
been
agreed
with
the
community
However
unless
real
action
is
taken
to
end
the
scourge
of
oil
theft
and
illegal
refining
which
remains
the
main
cause
of
environmental
pollution
and
is
the
real
tragedy
of
the
Niger
Delta
areas
that
are
cleaned
up
will
simply
become
re-impacted
through
these
illegal
activities
SPDC
has
made
great
efforts
to
raise
awareness
of
the
issue
with
the
government
of
Nigeria
international
bodies
like
the
United
Nations
the
media
civil
society
and
international
non-governmental
organisations
NGOs
and
we
will
continue
to
play
an
active
role
in
the
search
for
solutions
We
urge
all
those
with
influence
including
Bodo
community
leaders
and
NGO
groups
to
support
this
effort
